          <p>Slow down you crazy child<br>
You’re so ambitious for a juvenile<br>
But then if you’re so smart tell me why<br>
You are still so afraid?<br>
Where’s the fire, what’s the hurry about?<br>
You better cool it off before you burn it out<br>
You got so much to do and only<br>
So many hours in a day<br>
But you know that when the truth is told<br>
That you can get what you want<br>
Or you an just get old<br>
You’re gonna kick off before you even get halfway through<br>
When will you realize<br>
Vienna waits for you<br>
Slow down you’re doing fine<br>
You can’t be everything you want to be<br>
Before your time<br>
Although it’s so romantic on the borderline tonight<br>
Too bad but it’s the life you lead<br>
You’re so ahead of yourself<br>
That you forgot what you need<br>
Though you can see when you’re wrong<br>
But you know you can’t always see when you’re right<br>
You got your passion you got your pride<br>
But don’t you know only fools are satisfied?<br>
Dream on, but don’t imagine they’ll all come true<br>
When will you realize<br>
Vienna waits for you<br>
Slow down you crazy child<br>
Take the phone off the hook<br>
And disappeaar for a while<br>
It’s alright you can afford to lose a day or two<br>
When will you realize<br>
Vienna waits for you.</p>
