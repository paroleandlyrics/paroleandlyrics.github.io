          <p>A picture postcard, a folded stub<br>
A program of the play<br>
File away the photographs of your holiday<br>
And your mementos will turn to dust<br>
But that’s the price you pay<br>
For every year is a souvenir<br>
That slowly fades away<br>
Every year’s a souvenir<br>
That slowly fades away</p>
