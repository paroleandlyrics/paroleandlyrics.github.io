          <p>Los Angelenos<br>
All come from somewhere<br>
To live in sunshine<br>
Their funky exile<br>
Midwestern ladies<br>
High-heeled and faded<br>
Drivin’ sleek new sports cars<br>
With their New York cowboys<br>
Hiding up in the mountains<br>
Laying low in the canyons<br>
Goin’ nowhere in the streets<br>
With the Spanish names<br>
Makin’ love with the natives<br>
In their Hollywood places<br>
Making up for all the time gone by</p>
<p>Los Angelenos<br>
All came from somewhere<br>
Cuz it’s all so easy<br>
To become acquainted<br>
Electric babies<br>
Blue-jeaned and jaded<br>
Such hot sweet schoolgirls<br>
So educated<br>
Tanning out in the beaches<br>
With their Mexican reefers<br>
No one ever has to feel<br>
Like a refugee<br>
Going into garages<br>
For exotic massages<br>
Making up for all the time gone by</p>
<p>Hiding up in the mountains<br>
Laying low in the canyons<br>
Goin’ nowhere in the streets<br>
With the Spanish names<br>
Makin’ love with the natives<br>
In their Hollywood places<br>
Making up for all the time gone by<br>
Los Angelenos<br>
All came from somewhere<br>
It’s so familiar<br>
Their foreign faces</p>
