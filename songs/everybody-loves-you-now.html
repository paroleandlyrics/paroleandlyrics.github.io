          <p>Baby all the lights are turned on you<br>
Now you’re in the center of the stage<br>
Ev’rything revolves on what you do<br>
Ah, you are in your prime<br>
You’ve come of age<br>
You can always have your way somehow<br>
‘Cause ev’rybody loves you now</p>
<p>You can walk away from your mistakes<br>
You can turn your back on what you do<br>
Just a little smile is all it takes<br>
And you can have your cake and eat it too<br>
Loneliness will get to you somehow<br>
But ev’rybody loves you now</p>
<p>Ah, they all want your white body<br>
And they await your reply<br>
Ah, but between you and me and the Staten Island ferry<br>
So do I</p>
<p>All the people want to know your name<br>
Soon there will be lines outside your door<br>
Feelings do not matter in your game<br>
‘Cause nothing’s gonna touch you anymore<br>
So your life is only living anyhow<br>
And ev’rybody loves you now</p>
<p>Close your eyes when you don’t want to see<br>
And stay at home when you don’t want to go<br>
Only speak to those who will agree<br>
Yeah, and close your mind when you don’t want to know<br>
You have lost your innocense somehow<br>
But ev’rybody loves you now<br>
Ah, you know that nothin’ lasts forever<br>
And it’s all been done before<br>
Ah, but you ain’t got the time<br>
To go to Cold Spring Harbor no more</p>
<p>See how all the people gather ’round<br>
Hey, isn’t it a thrill to see them all crawl<br>
Keep your eyes ahead and don’t look down<br>
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall<br>
This is what you wanted, ain’t you proud<br>
‘Cause ev’rybody loves you now</p>
