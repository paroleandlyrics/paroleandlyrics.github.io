          <p>Where’s the orchestra?<br>
Wasn’t this supposed to be a musical?<br>
Here I am in the balcony<br>
How the hell could I have missed the overture?<br>
I like the scenery<br>
Even though I have absolutely no<br>
Idea at all<br>
What is being said<br>
Despite the dialogue<br>
There’s the leading man<br>
The movie star who never faced an audience</p>
<p>Where’s the orchestra?<br>
After all<br>
This is my big night on the town<br>
My introduction to the theatre crowd<br>
I assumed that the show would have a song<br>
So I was wrong<br>
At least I understand<br>
All the innuendo and the irony<br>
And I appreciate<br>
The roles the actors played<br>
The point the author made<br>
And after the closing lines<br>
And after the curtain calls<br>
The curtain falls<br>
On empty chairs<br>
Where’s the orchestra?</p>
