          <p>Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams there stood a house<br>
And a man who painted nature scenes.<br>
He painted trees<br>
And fields and animals and streams<br>
And he stayed and he didn’t hear the falling of the rain<br>
No, he didn’t hear the falling of the rain</p>
<p>In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids and she sang<br>
As she walked all about the wooded glades.<br>
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face<br>
And she sang, ’cause she didn’t mind the falling of the rain<br>
No, she didn’t mind the falling of the rain<br>
Will it always be the same as we recall?<br>
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?<br>
Ah, but I don’t want to know and I don’t want to see<br>
Another rainy day without you lying next to me, ah.</p>
<p>High upon a hill far away from the dusty crowd is a boy<br>
With his eyes on the ground, his head is bowed.<br>
He’s a fool and his mind is filled with hopeless dreams<br>
And he waits, but he will not see the falling of the rain<br>
No, he will not see the falling of the rain<br>
Will it always be the same as we recall?<br>
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?<br>
Ah, but I don’t want to know and I don’t want to see<br>
Another rainy day without you lying next to me, ah.</p>
<p>So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day,<br>
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away.<br>
And it seems that time has brought things to an end.<br>
Nothing’s changed, ’cause you can’t stop the falling of the rain,<br>
Can’t stop the falling of the rain.</p>
