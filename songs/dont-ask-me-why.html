          <p>All the waiters in your grand cafe<br>
Leave their tables when you blink<br>
Every dog must have his everyday<br>
Every drunk must have his drink<br>
Don’t wait for answers<br>
Just take your chances<br>
Don’t ask me why</p>
<p>All your life you had to stand in line<br>
Still you’re standing on your feet<br>
All you choices made you change your mind<br>
Now your calendar’s complete<br>
Don’t wait for answers<br>
Just take your chances<br>
Don’t ask me why</p>
<p>You can say the human heart<br>
Is only make-believe<br>
And I am only fighting fire with fire<br>
But you are still a victim<br>
Of the accidents you leave<br>
As sure as I’m a victim of desire</p>
<p>All the servants in your new hotel<br>
Throw their roses at your feet<br>
Fool them all but baby I can tell<br>
You’re no stranger to the street<br>
Don’t ask for favors<br>
Don’t talk to strangers<br>
Don’t ask me why</p>
<p>Yesterday you were an only child<br>
Now your ghosts have gone away<br>
You can kill them in the classic style<br>
Now you, “parlez vous francais”<br>
Don’t look for answers<br>
You took your chances<br>
Don’t ask my why<br>
Don’t ask me why</p>
