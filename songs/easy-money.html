          <p>You don’t have to talk all night<br>
I’m a man who can’t say no<br>
You don’t have to twist my arm<br>
Just point me where you want me to go<br>
Take me to the action<br>
Take me to the track<br>
Take me to a party if they’re bettin’ in the back<br>
I’ve been working all my life<br>
Can’t afford to wait<br>
Let me call my wife so I can tell her I’ll be late</p>
<p>I want easy money<br>
Easy money<br>
Easy money<br>
I could get lucky<br>
Oh, things could go right</p>
<p>I want the easy<br>
Easy money<br>
Easy money<br>
Maybe this one time<br>
Maybe tonight</p>
<p>You don’t have to try too hard<br>
I don’t need a song and dance<br>
I don’t need an invitation<br>
If you’ve got a game of chance<br>
Take me to the tables<br>
Take me to the fights<br>
Run me like the numbers<br>
Roll me like the dice</p>
<p>When you’re counting on a killing<br>
Always count me in<br>
Talk to me into losin’ just as long as I can win</p>
<p>I want the easy<br>
Easy money<br>
Easy money<br>
I want the good times<br>
Oh, I never had<br>
I want the easy<br>
Easy money<br>
I want the good life<br>
I want it bad</p>
<p>Easy money<br>
You say I fool myself<br>
But better me than someone else<br>
I got a hot slot machine of a system<br>
Ready to go<br>
Easy money<br>
I got a one track mind<br>
And a good reputation laying on the line<br>
I’ll either come back a bum or a king<br>
Baby, I don’t know</p>
<p>You don’t have to start a fight<br>
I’m a man who can’t say no<br>
If you’ve got a little risky business<br>
Just point me where you want to go<br>
Take me to the power<br>
Take me to the heat<br>
Take me to the cleaners<br>
If it’s open to the street<br>
Something’s got to pay off<br>
Something’s got to break<br>
Someone’s got a fortune that they’re begging<br>
Me to take</p>
<p>I want the easy<br>
Easy money<br>
Easy money<br>
I could get lucky<br>
Things could go right<br>
I want the easy<br>
Easy money<br>
Easy money<br>
Maybe just this time<br>
Oh maybe tonight<br>
Easy money<br>
Oh I don’t want no hard cash<br>
I just want the easy money<br>
I could get lucky</p>
