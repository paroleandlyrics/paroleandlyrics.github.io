          <p>Some days when I’m far away<br>
In a lonely room in a cold seclusion<br>
Some nights when I’m wound so tight<br>
There is no release, there is no solution<br>
In hell there’s a big hotel<br>
Where the bar just closed and the windows never opened<br>
No phone so you can’t call home<br>
And the T.V. works, but the clicker is broken<br>
But in the darkness I see your light turned on<br>
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to</p>
<p>Blonde over blue…your hands are cold, your eyes are fire<br>
Blonde over blue…they shine as though you’re burning inside<br>
One word from you is all I need to be inspired<br>
Blonde over blue…I need your inspiration tonight</p>
<p>These days there’s a million ways<br>
To be pulled and torn, to be misdirected<br>
These times there are sins and crimes<br>
On the morning shows for the disconnected<br>
I look and I write my book<br>
And I walk away with the wrong impressions<br>
I don’t care ’cause I’ve done my share And I need some time for my own obsessions<br>
It doesn’t matter, I’ve let that life go by<br>
It’s been forgotten ’cause all I wanted was you</p>
<p>Blonde over blue…your hands are cold, your eyes are fire<br>
Blonde over blue…they shine as though you’re burning inside<br>
One word from you is all I need to be inspired<br>
Blonde over blue…I need your inspiration tonight</p>
<p>These days not a damn soul prays<br>
And there is no faith ’cause there’s nothing to believe in<br>
These days only good luck pays<br>
If we don’t get paid then we try to get even<br>
I look and I write my book<br>
And I have my say and I draw conclusions<br>
Some nights when I’m wound so tight<br>
There is no release there is no solution<br>
But in the darkness I see your light turned on<br>
You know my weakness, you know how I respond to</p>
<p>Blonde over blue…your hands are cold, your eyes are fire<br>
Blonde over blue…they shine as though you’re burning inside<br>
One word from you is all I need to be inspired<br>
Blonde over blue…I need your inspiration tonight</p>
