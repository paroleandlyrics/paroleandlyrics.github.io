          <p>You’re having a hard time and lately you don’t feel so good<br>
You’re getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood<br>
It’s alright, it’s alright<br>
Sometimes that’s what it takes<br>
You’re only human, you’re allowed to make your share of mistakes</p>
<p>You better believe there will be times in your life<br>
When youÔÇÜll be feeling like a stumbling fool<br>
So take it from me you’ll learn more from you accidents<br>
Than anything you could ever learn at school</p>
<p>Don’t forget your second wind<br>
Sooner or later you’ll get your second wind<br>
It’s not always easy to be living in this world of pain<br>
You’re gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again<br>
It’s alright, it’s alright</p>
<p>Though you feel your heart break<br>
You’re only human, your gonna have to deal with heartache<br>
Just like a boxer in a title fight<br>
You got to walk in that ring all alone<br>
You’re not the only one who’s made mistakes<br>
But they’re the only things that you can truly call your own</p>
<p>Don’t forget your second wind<br>
Wait in your corner until that breeze blows in</p>
<p>You’ve been keeping to yourself these days<br>
Cause you’re thinking everything’s gone wrong<br>
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die<br>
That emotion can be so strong<br>
But hold on<br>
Till that old second wind comes along</p>
<p>You probably don’t want to hear advice from someone else<br>
But I wouldn’t be telling you if I hadn’t been there myself<br>
It’s alright, it’s alright<br>
Sometimes that’s all it takes<br>
We’re only human<br>
We’re supposed to make mistakes<br>
But I survived all those long lonely days<br>
When it seemed I did not have a friend<br>
Cause all I needed was a little faith<br>
So I could catch my breath and face the world again<br>
Don’t forget your second wind<br>
Sooner or later you’ll feel that momentum kick in<br>
Don’t forget your second wind<br>
Sooner or later you’ll feel that momentum kick in</p>
