          <p>Don’t get me wrong<br>
I ain’t the kind <br>
To turn away from you<br>
When something’s on your mind<br>
But you had to know<br>
You just had to see<br>
I’m having my troubles baby<br>
And they’re all too much for me</p>
<p>You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration<br>
You picked a real bad time to pass along bad news<br>
Tell me why you’re tryin’ to give me aggravation<br>
You picked a real bad time ’cause this man’s got the blues</p>
<p>Don’t you get me wrong<br>
You’re not alone<br>
I’d like to help you<br>
But I got problems of my own<br>
It’s a bitter phase<br>
I’m going through<br>
And I can run from strangers, darling<br>
But I just can’t hide from you</p>
<p>You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration<br>
You picked a real bad time to pass along bad news<br>
Tell me why you’re tryin’ to give me aggravation<br>
You picked a real bad time and I ain’t got time to lose</p>
<p>Ain’t it the truth when they say<br>
That the only thing worth dying for is our freedom<br>
Ain’t it the truth that someday<br>
We will all be lying on our backs<br>
Free at last from income</p>
<p>Don’t you get me wrong<br>
The mood won’t last<br>
And I’ll be myself again<br>
Soon as this pain passed<br>
I’m standing here<br>
Don’t ask me how<br>
I’ll make it up to you<br>
Someday but not right now</p>
<p>You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration<br>
You picked a real bad time to pass along bad news<br>
Tell me why you’re tryin’ to give me aggravation<br>
You picked a real bad time ’cause this man’s got the blues</p>
<p>Ain’t it the truth when they say<br>
All you need is love<br>
But all you’ll want is forgiveness<br>
Ain’t it the proof that someday<br>
Even love will not provide for man<br>
The ways that life insurance can</p>
<p>You picked a real bad time to spoil my concentration<br>
You picked a real bad time to pass along bad news</p>
<p>Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me<br>
Tell me why you’re tryin’ to give me aggravation<br>
You picked a real bad time ’cause this man’s got the blues</p>
