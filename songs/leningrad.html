          <p>Viktor was born in the spring of ’44<br>
And never saw his father anymore<br>
A child of sacrifice, a child of war<br>
Another son who never had a father after Leningrad</p>
<p>Went off to school and learned to serve the state<br>
Followed the rules and drank his vodka straight<br>
The only way to live was drown the hate<br>
A Russian life was very sad<br>
And such was life in Leningrad</p>
<p>I was born in ’49<br>
A cold war kid in McCarthy time<br>
Stop ’em all at the 38th Parallel<br>
Blast those yellow reds to hell<br>
And cold war kids were hard to kill<br>
Under their desks in an air raid drill<br>
Haven’t they heard we won the war<br>
What do they keep on fighting for?</p>
<p>Viktor was sent to some Red Army town<br>
Served out his time, became a circus clown<br>
The greatest happiness he’d ever found<br>
Was making Russian children glad<br>
And children lived in Leningrad</p>
<p>But children lived in Levittown<br>
And hid in the shelters underground<br>
Until the Soviets turned their ships around<br>
And tore the Cuban missiles down<br>
And in that bright October sun<br>
We knew our childhood days were done<br>
And I watched my friends go off to war<br>
What do they keep on fighting for?</p>
<p>And so my child and I came to this place<br>
To meet him eye to eye and face to face<br>
He made my daughter laugh, then we embraced<br>
We never knew what friends we had<br>
Until we came to Leningrad</p>
