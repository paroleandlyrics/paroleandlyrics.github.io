          <p>Everybody’s got a million questions<br>
Everybody wants to know the score<br>
What you went through<br>
It’s something you<br>
Should be over now</p>
<p>Everybody wants to hear the secrets<br>
That you never told a soul before<br>
And it’s not that strange<br>
Because it wouldn’t change<br>
What happened anyhow</p>
<p>But you swore to yourself a long time ago<br>
There were some things that people never needed to know<br>
This is one that you keep<br>
That you bury so deep<br>
No one can tear it out</p>
<p>And you can’t talk about it<br>
Because you’re following a code of silence<br>
You’re never gonna lose the anger<br>
You just deal with it a different way<br>
And you can’t talk about it<br>
And isn’t that a kind of madness<br>
To be living by a code of silence<br>
When you’ve really got a lot to say</p>
<p>You don’t want to lose a friendship<br>
There’ s nothing that you have to hide<br>
And a little dirt couldn’t hurt no one anyway<br>
And you still have a rage inside you<br>
That you carry with certain pride<br>
In the only part of a broken heart<br>
That you could never save</p>
<p>But you’ve been through it once, yo know how it ends<br>
You don’t see the point of going through it again,<br>
And this ain’t the place, and this ain’t the time,<br>
And neither’s any other day<br>
So you can’t talk about it<br>
Because your following a code of silence<br>
You’re never gonna lose the anger<br>
You just deal within it a different way<br>
So you can’t talk about it<br>
And isn’t that a kind of madness<br>
To be living by a code of silence<br>
When you’ve really got a lot to say</p>
<p>I know you well enough to tell you’ve got your reasons<br>
That’s not the kind of code you’re inclined to break<br>
Some things unknown are best left alone forever<br>
And if a vow is what it takes<br>
Haven’t you paid for your mistakes</p>
<p>After the moment passes<br>
And the impulse disappears<br>
You can still hold back<br>
Because you don’t crack very easily</p>
<p>It’s a time honored resolution<br>
Because the danger is always near<br>
It’s with you now<br>
But that ain’t how it was supposed to be</p>
<p>And it’s hard to believe after all these years<br>
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears<br>
And you feel like a fool, because in spite of your rules<br>
You’ve got a memory</p>
<p>But you can’t talk about it<br>
Because you’re following a code of silence<br>
You’re never gonna lose the anger<br>
You just deal with it a different way<br>
But you can’t talk about it<br>
And isn’t that a kind of madness<br>
To be living by a code of silence<br>
When you’ve really got a lot to say</p>
