          <p>They say that these are not the best of times<br>
But they’re the only times I’ve ever known<br>
And I believe there is a time for meditation<br>
In cathedrals of our own</p>
<p>Now, I have seen that sad surrender in my lover’s eyes<br>
And I can only stand apart and sympathize<br>
For we are always what our situations hand us<br>
It’s either sadness or euphoria</p>
<p>So we’ll argue and we’ll compromise<br>
And realize that nothing’s ever changed<br>
For all our mutual experience,<br>
Our separate conclusions are the same</p>
<p>Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity<br>
Our reason coexists with our insanity<br>
And though we choose between reality and madness<br>
It’s either sadness or euphoria</p>
<p>How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies<br>
Perhaps we don’t fulfill each others fantasies<br>
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives,<br>
With our respective similarities<br>
It’s either sadness or euphoria</p>
