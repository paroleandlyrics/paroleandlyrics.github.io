          <p>Oh, oh, oh<br>
For the longest time<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
For the longest time<br>
If you said goodbye to me tonight<br>
There would still be music left to write<br>
What else could I do<br>
I'm so inspired by you<br>
That hasn't happened for the longest time</p>
<p>Once I thought my innocence was gone<br>
Now I know that happiness goes on<br>
That's where you found me<br>
When you put your arms around me<br>
I haven't been there for the longest time</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh<br>
For the longest time<br>
Oh, oh, oh<br>
For the longest time<br>
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall<br>
And the greatest miracle of all<br>
Is how I need you<br>
And how you needed me too<br>
That hasn't happened for the longest time</p>
<p>Maybe this won't last very long<br>
But you feel so right<br>
And I could be wrong<br>
Maybe I've been hoping too hard<br>
But I've gone this far<br>
And it's more that I hoped for</p>
<p>Who knows how much further we'll go on<br>
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone<br>
I'll take my chances<br>
I forgot how nice romance is<br>
I haven't been there for the longest time<br>
I had second thoughts at the start<br>
I said to myself<br>
Hold on to your heart<br>
Now I know the woman that you are<br>
You're wonderful so far<br>
And it's more that I hoped for</p>
<p>I don't care what consequence it brings<br>
I have been a fool for lesser things<br>
I want you so bad<br>
I think you ought to know that<br>
I intend to hold you for<br>
The longest time</p>
