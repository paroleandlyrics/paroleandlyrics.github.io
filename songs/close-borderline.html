          <p>Blackout, heatwave, .44 caliber homicide<br>
The buns drop dead and dogs go mad<br>
In packs on the West Side<br>
Young girl standing on a ledge looks like another suicide<br>
She wants to hit those bricks<br>
‘Cause the news at six gotta stick to a deadline<br>
While the millionaires hide in Beekman Place<br>
The bag ladies throw their bones in my face<br>
I get attacked by a kid with stereo sound<br>
I don’t want to hear it but he won’t turn it down<br>
Life is tough but it’s just enough<br>
To hold back the tears until it’s closing time<br>
I survived, I’m still alive<br>
But I’m getting close to the borderline<br>
Close to the borderline</p>
<p>A buck three eighty<br>
Won’t buy you much lately on the street these days<br>
And when you can get gas<br>
You know you can’t drive fast anymore on the parkways<br>
Rich man, poor man, either way American<br>
Shoved into the lost and found<br>
The no nuke yell we’re gonna all go to hell<br>
With the next big meltdown<br>
I got remote control and a color T.V.<br>
I don’t change channels so they must change me<br>
I got real close friends that will get me high<br>
They don’t know how to talk and they ain’t gonna try<br>
I shouldn’t bitch, I shouldn’t cry<br>
I’d start a revolution but I don’t have time<br>
I don’t know why I’m still a nice guy<br>
But I’m getting close to the borderline<br>
Close to the borderline</p>
<p>I thought I’d sacrifice so many things<br>
I thought I’d throw them all away<br>
I didn’t think I needed anything<br>
But you can’t afford to squander what you’re not prepared to pay</p>
<p>I need a doctor for my pressure pills<br>
I need a lawyer for my medical bills<br>
I need a banker to finance my home<br>
I need security to back my loan<br>
It isn’t new what I’m going through<br>
But everybody knows you got to break sometime<br>
Another night I fought the good fight<br>
But I’m getting closer to the borderline<br>
Closer to the borderline</p>
