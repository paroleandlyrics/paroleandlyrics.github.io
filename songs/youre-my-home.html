          <p>When you look into my eyes<br>
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul<br>
It always comes as a surprise<br>
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow<br>
Well, I never had a place that I could call my very own<br>
But that’s alright my love,<br>
‘Cause your my home</p>
<p>When you touch my weary head<br>
And you tell me ev’rything will be alright<br>
You say use my body for your bed<br>
And my love will keep you warm throughout the night<br>
Well, I’ll never be a stranger<br>
And I’ll never be alone<br>
Where ever we’re together that’s my home</p>
<p>Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike<br>
Indiana early morning dew<br>
High up in the hills of California<br>
Home is just another word for you</p>
<p>If I traveled all my life<br>
And I never get to stop and settle down<br>
Long as I have you by my side<br>
There’s a roof above and good walls all around<br>
You’re my castle, you’re my cabin and my instant pleasure dome<br>
I need you in my house ’cause you’re my home</p>
