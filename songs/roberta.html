          <p>Roberta, you say you know me<br>
But I see only what you’re paid to show me<br>
Oh, I wish you had the time<br>
Oh, I wish you had the time, oh</p>
<p>Roberta, I understand you<br>
I know you need to move in other circles too<br>
It’s tough for me<br>
It’s tough for you</p>
<p>Roberta, how I’ve adored you<br>
I’d ask you over but I can’t afford you<br>
Oh, I wish you’d take the time<br>
Oh, I wish you’d take the time, oh</p>
<p>Roberta, the night goes slowly<br>
I know you’re workin’ but you must get lonely too<br>
It’s tough for me, It’s tough for you<br>
And I’m in in a bad way and I wanna make love to you, oo, oo<br>
Oh, I wish you had the time<br>
Oh, I wish you had the time, oh</p>
<p>Roberta, I really need you<br>
But I suppose that my small change won’t see you through<br>
It’s tough for me, it’s tough for you</p>
