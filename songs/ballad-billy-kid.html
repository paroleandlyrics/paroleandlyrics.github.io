          <p>From a town known as Wheeling West Virginia<br>Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand<br>And his daring life of crime made him a legend in his time<br>East and west of the Rio Grande<br>Well he started with a bank in Colorado<br>In the pocket of his vest a Colt he hid<br>And his age and his size took the teller by surprise<br>And the word spread of Billy the Kid</p>
<p>Well he never traveled heavy,<br>Yes he always rode alone,<br>And he soon put many older guns to shame<br>Well he never had a sweetheart<br>And he never had a home<br>But the cowboys and the ranchers knew his name</p>
<p>Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma<br>And the law just couldn't seem to track him down<br>And it served his legend well<br>For the folks loved to tell<br>'Bout when Billy the Kid came to town</p>
<p>One cold day a posse captured Billy<br>And the judge said string him up for what he did<br>And the cowboys and their kin<br>Like the sea came pouring in to watch<br>The hangin' of Billy the Kid</p>
<p>Well he never traveled heavy,<br>Yes he always rode alone,<br>And he soon put many older guns to shame<br>Well he never had a sweetheart<br>Tho' he finally found a home<br>Underneath the boothill grave that bears his name</p>
<p>From a town known as Oysterbay, Long Island<br>Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand<br>And his daring life of crime made him a legend in his time<br>East and west of the Rio Grande</p>
