          <p>Well I’m shameless when it comes to loving you<br>
I’d do anything you want me to<br>
I’d do anything at all</p>
<p>And I’m standing here for all the world to see<br>
There ain’t that much left of me<br>
That has very far to fall</p>
<p>You know I’m not a man who has ever been<br>
Insecure about the world I’ve been living in<br>
I don’t break easy, I have my pride<br>
But if you need to be satisfied</p>
<p>I’m shameless, baby I don’t have a prayer<br>
Anytime I see you standing there<br>
I go down upon my knees</p>
<p>And I’m changing, I swore I’d never compromise<br>
But you convinced me otherwise<br>
I’ll do anything you please</p>
<p>You see in all my life I’ve never found<br>
What I couldn’t resist, what I couldn’t turn down<br>
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew<br>
But I can’t walk away from you</p>
<p>I have never let anything have this much control over me<br>
Cause I worked too hard to call me life my own<br>
Yes I made myself a world and it worked so perfectly<br>
But it’s your world now, I can’t refuse<br>
I never had so much to lose<br>
I’m shameless…shameless</p>
<p>You know it should be easy for a man who’s strong<br>
To say he’s sorry or admit when he’s wrong<br>
I’ve never lost anything I ever missed<br>
But I’ve never been in love like this…<br>
It’s out of my hands<br>
I’m shameless, I don’t have the power now<br>
But I don’t want it anyhow<br>
So I’ve got to let it go</p>
<p>I’m shameless, shameless as a man can be<br>
You can make a total fool of me<br>
I just wanted you to know</p>
<p>I am shameless<br>
Shameless…<br>
Shameless…</p>
