          <p>She said she’d meet me in the bar<br>
At the Plaza Hotel<br>
“Wear a jacket and a tie”<br>
“What’s the occasion?”<br>
She just smiled and she wouldn’t say why<br>
So here I am standing , waiting in the lobby<br>
Sweating bullets in this stupid old suit<br>
And when she sees me she busts out laughing<br>
“You’re a sad sight honey, but you look so cute” and</p>
<p>I don’t want to be alone anymore<br>
I was checking you out<br>
I was just making sure<br>
No, I don’t want to be alone anymore<br>
And, I want you tonight<br>
Although you hurt me before<br>
It didn’t matter that I felt like a fool<br>
‘Cause I forgot when she walked through the door<br>
I said I’m sorry, but she said it was cool<br>
And I don’t want to be alone anymore</p>
<p>It’s so confusing choosing sides<br>
In the heat of the moment<br>
Just to see if it’s real<br>
It’s so erotic having you<br>
Tell me how it should feel<br>
But I’m avoiding all the hard cold facts<br>
That I’ve got to face<br>
So ask me just one question<br>
When this magic night is through<br>
Could it have been just anyone<br>
Or did it have to be you<br>
And, will you still be saying-</p>
<p>I don’t want to be alone anymore<br>
I was checking you out<br>
I was just making sure<br>
No, I don’t want to be alone anymore<br>
And, I want you tonight<br>
Although you hurt me before<br>
It didn’t matter that I felt like a fool<br>
‘Cause I forgot when she walked through the door<br>
I said I’m sorry, but she said it was cool<br>
And I don’t want to be alone anymore</p>
<p>But, don’t you know that it’s wrong<br>
It’s wrong, it’s wrong<br>
But like the song<br>
Being caught by the wink of an eye<br>
I can’t be sure we’ll get along<br>
But I’m willing to try<br>
As long as you can tell me-</p>
<p>I don’t want to be alone anymore<br>
I was checking you out<br>
I was just making sure<br>
No, I don’t want to be alone anymore<br>
And, I want you tonight<br>
Although you hurt me before<br>
It didn’t matter that I felt like a fool<br>
‘Cause I forgot when she walked through the door<br>
I said I’m sorry, but she said it was cool<br>
And I don’t want to be alone anymore</p>
