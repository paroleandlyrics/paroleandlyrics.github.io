          <p>Well so, here I am at the end of the road<br>
Where do I go from here?<br>
I always figured it would be like this<br>
Still nothin’ seems to be quite clear</p>
<p>All the words have been spoken<br>
And the prophecy fulfilled<br>
But I just can’t decide where to go<br>
Yes, it’s been quite a day<br>
And I should go to sleep<br>
But tomorrow I will wake up and I’ll know<br>
That I’ve got to begin again<br>
Though I don’t know how to start<br>
Yes, I’ve got to begin again, and it’s hard</p>
<p>Well, it’s been quite a while since I lifted my head<br>
And I’m sure the light will hurt my eyes<br>
I see the way that I’ve been spendin’ my days<br>
And reality has caught my by surprise<br>
I was dreamin’ of tomorrow,<br>
So I sacrificed today,<br>
And it sure was a grand waste of time<br>
And despite all the truth that’s been thrown in my face<br>
I just can’t get you out of my mind<br>
But I’ve got to begin again<br>
Though I don’t know how to start<br>
Yes, I’ve got to begin again, and it’s hard<br>
Yes, it’s hard, oh, ooh, ooh</p>
