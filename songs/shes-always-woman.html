          <p>She can kill with a smile<br>
She can wound with her eyes<br>
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies<br>
And she only reveals what she wants you to see<br>
She hides like a child<br>
But she’s always a woman to me<br>
She can lead you to live<br>
She can take you or leave you<br>
She can ask for the truth<br>
But she’ll never believe you<br>
And she’ll take what you give her as long as it’s free<br>
She steals like a thief<br>
But she’s always a woman to me<br>
Oh, she takes care of herself<br>
She can wait if she wants<br>
She’s ahead of her time<br>
Oh, and she never gives out<br>
And she never gives in<br>
She just changes her mind<br>
She will promise you more<br>
Than the Garden of Eden<br>
Then she’ll carelessly cut you<br>
And laugh while you’re bleedin’<br>
But she’ll bring out the best<br>
And the worst you can be<br>
Blame it all on yourself<br>
Cause she’s always a woman to me<br>
She is frequently kind<br>
And she’s suddenly cruel<br>
She can do as she pleases<br>
She’s nobody’s fool<br>
But she can’t be convicted<br>
She’s earned her degree<br>
And the most she will do<br>
Is throw shadows at you<br>
But she’s always a woman to me</p>
