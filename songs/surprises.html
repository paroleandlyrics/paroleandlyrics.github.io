          <p>Don’t get excited<br>
Don’t say a word<br>
Nobody noticed<br>
Nothing was heard<br>
It was committed discreetly<br>
It was handled so neatly<br>
And it shouldn’t surprise you at all<br>
You know</p>
<p>Break all the records<br>
Burn the cassettes<br>
I’d be lying if I told you<br>
That I had no regrets<br>
There were so many mistakes<br>
And what a difference it makes<br>
But still it shouldn’t surprise you at all<br>
You know</p>
<p>I said it shouldn’t surprise you at all<br>
You know</p>
<p>Don’t look now but you have changed<br>
Your best friends wouldn’t tell you</p>
<p>Now it’s apparent<br>
Now it’s a fact<br>
So marshal your forces<br>
For another attack You were so young and naive<br>
I know it’s hard to believe<br>
But now it shouldn’t surprise you at all<br>
You know</p>
<p>No it shouldn’t surprise you at all<br>
You know</p>
<p>What has it cost you<br>
What have you won<br>
The sins of the fathers<br>
Are the sins of the sons<br>
It was always within you<br>
It will always continue<br>
But it shouldn’t surprise you at all<br>
You know<br>
I said it shouldn’t surprise you at all<br>
You know</p>
