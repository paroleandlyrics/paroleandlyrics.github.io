          <p>Seen the lights go out Broadway<br>
I saw the Empire State laid low<br>
And life went on beyond the Palisades<br>
They all bought Cadillacs<br>
And left there long ago</p>
<p>They held a concert out in Brooklyn<br>
To watch the island bridges blow<br>
They turned our power down<br>
And drove us underground<br>
But we went right on with the show</p>
<p>I’ve seen the lights go out on Broadway<br>
I saw the ruins at my feet<br>
You know we almost didn’t notice it<br>
We’d seen it all the time on Forty second street</p>
<p>They burned the churches down in Harlem<br>
Like in that Spanish civil war<br>
The flames were everywhere<br>
But no one really cared<br>
It always burned up there before</p>
<p>I’ve seen the lights go out on Broadway<br>
I saw the mighty skyline fall<br>
The boats were waiting at The Battery<br>
The union went on strike<br>
They never sailed at all</p>
<p>They sent a carrier out from Norfolk<br>
And picked the Yankees up for free<br>
They said that Queens could stay<br>
And blew the Bronx away<br>
And sank Manhattan out at sea</p>
<p>You know those lights were bright on Broadway<br>
That was so many years ago<br>
Before we all lived here in Florida<br>
Before the Mafia took over Mexico<br>
There are not many who remember<br>
They say a handful still survive<br>
To tell the world about<br>
The way the lights went out<br>
And keep the memory alive</p>
