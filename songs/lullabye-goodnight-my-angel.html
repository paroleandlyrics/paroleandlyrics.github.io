          <p>Goodnight, my angel<br>
Time to close your eyes<br>
And save these questions for another day<br>
I think I know what you’ve been asking me<br>
I think you know what I’ve been trying to say<br>
I promised I would never leave you<br>
And you should always know<br>
Wherever you may go<br>
No matter where you are<br>
I never will be far away</p>
<p>Goodnight, my angel<br>
Now it’s time to sleep<br>
And still so many things I want to say<br>
Remember all the songs you sang for me<br>
When we went sailing on an emerald bay<br>
And like a boat out on the ocean<br>
I’m rocking you to sleep<br>
The water’s dark<br>
And deep inside this ancient heart<br>
You’ll always be a part of me</p>
<p>Goodnight, my angel<br>
Now it’s time to dream<br>
And dream how wonderful your life will be<br>
Someday your child may cry<br>
And if you sing this lullabye<br>
Then in your heart<br>
There will always be a part of me</p>
<p>Someday we’ll all be gone<br>
But lullabyes go on and on…<br>
They never die<br>
That’s how you<br>
And I<br>
Will be</p>
