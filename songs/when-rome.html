          <p>Well I see you in the morning<br>
Putting on your pretty clothes<br>
And I watch you do your makeup<br>
Like they do in all those fashion shows<br>
Then you turn to me so that I can see<br>
If you put your self together right<br>
Then you go away and you’re gone all day<br>
But I know you’re coming home tonight<br>
And when you’re home, darling all you’ve got to be is you<br>
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do</p>
<p>Well it’s alright if you’re tired when your day is done<br>
You can see when you look at me, you’re not the only one<br>
It’s a cold, cruel world for a working girl<br>
But you can’t let them see you cry<br>
It’s a fact of life, now a man and wife<br>
Work full time to just get by<br>
And when we’re home all it’s gonna be is me and you<br>
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do</p>
<p>I’ve done some strange things I never thought I’d do before<br>
But if the strain brings happiness, more or less…</p>
<p>Then I don’t mind masquerading with all those other fools<br>
I don’t mind the games I’m playing,<br>
Because I’ve learned the rules<br>
And when times are tough, I’ve got just enough<br>
If you’re standing right by my side<br>
Darling more and more I get hungry for<br>
All the ways you keep me satisfied<br>
On our own there ain’t nothing that we can’t get thru<br>
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do</p>
<p>Then I don’t mind masquerading with all those other fools<br>
I don’t mind the games I’m playing,<br>
Because I’ve learned the rules<br>
It doesn’t matter when we’re home, all alone<br>
All we’ve got to be is me and you<br>
On our own there ain’t nothing that we can’t get thru<br>
But when in Rome, do as the Romans do</p>
