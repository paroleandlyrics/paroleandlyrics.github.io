          <p>You have to learn to pace yourself<br>
Pressure<br>
You’re just like everybody else<br>
Pressure<br>
You’ve only had to run so far<br>
So good<br>
But you will come to a place<br>
Where the only thing you feel<br>
Are loaded guns in your face<br>
And you’ll have to deal with<br>
Pressure</p>
<p>You used to call me paranoid<br>
Pressure<br>
But even you cannot avoid<br>
Pressure<br>
You turned the tap dance into your crusade<br>
Now here you are with your faith<br>
And your Peter Pan advice<br>
You have no scars on your face<br>
And you cannot handle<br>
Pressure</p>
<p>All grown up and no place to go<br>
Psych 1, Psych 2<br>
What do you know?<br>
All your life is channel 13<br>
Sesame Street<br>
What does it mean?</p>
<p>(I’ll tell you what it means)<br>
Pressure<br>
Pressure</p>
<p>Don’t ask for help<br>
You’re all alone<br>
Pressure<br>
You’ll have to answer<br>
To your own<br>
Pressure<br>
I’m sure you’ll have some cosmic rationale<br>
But here you are in the ninth<br>
Two men out and three men on<br>
Nowhere to look but inside<br>
Where we all respond to<br>
Pressure<br>
Pressure</p>
<p>All your life is Time Magazine<br>
I read it too<br>
What does it mean?</p>
<p>Pressure</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll have some cosmic rationale<br>
But here you are with your faith<br>
And your Peter Pan advice<br>
You have no scars on your face<br>
And you cannot handle<br>
Pressure<br>
Pressure<br>
Pressure<br>
One, two, three, four<br>
Pressure</p>
