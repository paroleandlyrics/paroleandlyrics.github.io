          <p>I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand<br>
Another serenader and another long haired band<br>
Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts,<br>
But I know the game, you'll forget my name,<br>
And I won't be here in another year<br>
If I don't stay on the charts</p>
<p>I am the entertainer and I've had to pay my price<br>
The things I did not know at first I learned by doing twice<br>
But still they come to haunt me, still they want their say<br>
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants, I let 'em rub my neck<br>
And I write 'em a check, and they go their merry way</p>
<p>I am the entertainer, been all around the world<br>
I've played all kinds of palaces and laid all kinds of girls<br>
I can't remember faces, I don't remember names<br>
But what the hell, you know it's just as well<br>
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles<br>
It all becomes the same</p>
<p>I am the entertainer, I bring to you my songs<br>
I'd like to spend a day or two but I can't stay that long<br>
I got to meet expenses, I got to stay in line<br>
Got to get those fees to the agencies<br>
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay<br>
So I just don't have the time</p>
<p>I am the entertainer, I've come to do my show<br>
You've heard my latest record, it's been on the radio<br>
It took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life<br>
It was a beautiful song but it ran too long<br>
If you're gonna have a hit you gotta make it fit<br>
So they cut it down to 3:05</p>
<p>I am the entertainer, the idol of my age<br>
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage<br>
You see me in the papers, I've been in the magazines<br>
But if I go cold, I won't get sold<br>
I get put in the back in the discount rack<br>
Like another can of beans</p>
<p>I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand<br>
Another serenader and another long haired band<br>
Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts,<br>
But I know the game, you'll forget my name,<br>
I won't be here in another year<br>
If I don't stay on the charts</p>
