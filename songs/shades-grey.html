          <p>Some things were perfectly clear, seen with the vision of youth<br>No doubts and nothing to fear, I claimed the corner on truth<br>These days it's harder to say I know what I'm fighting for<br>My faith is falling away<br>I'm not that sure anymore</p>
<p>Shades of grey wherever I go<br>The more I find out the less that I know<br>Black and white is how it should be<br>But shades of grey are the colors I see</p>
<p>Once there were trenches and walls and one point of every view<br>Fight 'til the other man falls – kill him before he kills you<br>These days the edges are blurred, I'm old and tired of war<br>I hear the other man's words<br>I'm not that sure anymore</p>
<p>Shades of grey are all that I find<br>When I look to the enemy line<br>Black and white was so easy for me<br>But shades of grey are the colors I see</p>
<p>Now with the wisdom of years, I try to reason things out<br>And the only people I fear are those who never have doubts<br>Save us all from arrogant men, and all the causes they're for<br>I won't be righteous again<br>I'm not that sure anymore</p>
<p>Shades of grey are all that I find<br>When I look to the enemy line<br>Ain't no rainbows shining on me<br>Shades of grey are the colors I see</p>
<p>Shades of grey wherever I go<br>The more I find out the less that I know<br>Ain't no rainbows shining on me<br>Shades of grey are the colors I see</p>
