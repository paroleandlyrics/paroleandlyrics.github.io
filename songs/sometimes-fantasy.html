          <p>I didn’t want to do it but I got too lonely<br>
I had to call you up in the middle of the night<br>
I know it’s awful hard to try and make love long distance<br>
But I really need stimulation<br>
Though it was only my imagination</p>
<p>It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing<br>
It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing<br>
But sometimes a fantasy<br>
Is all you need</p>
<p>When am I gonna take control get a hold of my emotions<br>
Why does it only seem to hit me in the middle of the night<br>
You told me there’s a number I can always dial for assistance<br>
I don’t want to deal with outside action<br>
Only you can give me satisfaction</p>
<p>It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing<br>
It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing<br>
But sometimes a fantasy<br>
Is all you need</p>
<p>Sure it would be better if I had you here to hold me<br>
Be better baby, but believe me it’s the next best thing<br>
I’m sure there’s many times you’ve wanted me to hear your secrets<br>
Don’t be afraid to say the words that move me<br>
Anytime you want to tell them to me</p>
<p>It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing<br>
It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing<br>
But sometimes a fantasy<br>
Is all you need</p>
<p>It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing<br>
It’s just a fantasy<br>
It’s not the real thing</p>
