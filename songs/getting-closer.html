          <p>I went searching for the truth<br>
But in my innocence I found<br>
All the con men and their acrobats<br>
Who stomped me in the ground<br>
If I count up their percentages<br>
I know they’re getting rich<br>
But they haven’t taken everything<br>
Those paybacks are a bitch</p>
<p>Though I’ve lost quite a lot<br>
I am still in control<br>
They can keep what they’ve got<br>
But they can’t have my soul<br>
And if I don’t have this all worked out<br>
Still I’m getting closer, getting closer<br>
I still have far to go no doubt<br>
But I’m getting closer, getting closer</p>
<p>What was ripped off by professionals<br>
Is not all that it seems<br>
While I must live up to contracts<br>
I did not give up my dreams<br>
If I see it as experience<br>
It hasn’t gone to waste<br>
Lately all the missing pieces<br>
Have been falling into place</p>
<p>And if I could go back and start over somehow<br>
I would not change that much<br>
Knowing what I know now<br>
Though there have been sins<br>
I will regret<br>
Still I’m getting closer, getting closer<br>
I don’t have all the answers yet<br>
But I’m getting closer, getting closer</p>
<p>I’m a mark for every shyster<br>
From Topanga to Berlin<br>
And I should have learned to kick them out<br>
As soon as they crawled in<br>
So to every bank in Switzerland<br>
That stores my stolen youth<br>
I’m alright because despite the laws<br>
You cannot hide the truth</p>
<p>And although you will say<br>
I am still too naive<br>
But I have not lost faith<br>
In the things I believe</p>
<p>And if I don’t have this all worked out<br>
Still I’m getting closer, getting closer<br>
I still have far to go no doubt<br>
But I’m still getting closer, getting closer</p>
