          <p>Ali dances and the audience applauds<br>Though he's bathed in sweat he hasn't lost his style<br>Ali don't you go downtown<br>You gave away another round for free</p>
<p>Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar<br>But the waitress always serves a secret smile<br>She's waiting out in Shantytown<br>She's gonna pull the curtains down for me, for me</p>
<p>I got the old man's car<br>I got a jazz guitar<br>I got a tab at Zanzibar<br>Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be</p>
<p>Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game<br>But the Yankees grab the headlines every time<br>Melodrama's so much fun<br>In black and white for everyone to see</p>
<p>Me, I'm trying just to get to second base<br>And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign<br>She's gonna give the go ahead<br>The inning isn't over yet for me, for me</p>
<p>I got the old man's car<br>I got a jazz guitar<br>I got a tab at Zanzibar<br>Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be</p>
<p>Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar<br>I'll be hiding in the darkness with my beer<br>She's waiting out in Shantytown<br>She's gonna pull the curtains down for me, for me</p>
<p>I got the old man's car<br>And I got a jazz guitar<br>I got a tab at Zanzibar<br>Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be</p>
