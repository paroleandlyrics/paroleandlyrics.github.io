          <p>Well we all have a face<br>That we hide away forever<br>And we take them out and show ourselves<br>When everyone has gone<br>Some are satin some are steel<br>Some are silk and some are leather<br>They're the faces of the stranger<br>But we love to try them on</p>
<p>Well, we all fall in love<br>But we disregard the danger<br>Though we share so many secrets<br>There are some we never tell<br>Why were you so surprised<br>That you never saw the stranger<br>Did you ever let your lover see<br>The stranger in yourself?</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to try again<br>Everyone goes south<br>Every now and then<br>You've done it, why can't someone else?<br>You should know by now<br>You've been there yourself</p>
<p>Once I used to believe<br>I was such a great romancer<br>Then I came home to a woman<br>That I could not recognize<br>When I pressed her for a reason<br>She refused to even answer<br>It was then I felt the stranger<br>Kick me right between the eyes</p>
<p>Well, we all fall in love<br>But we disregard the danger<br>Though we share so many secrets<br>There are some we never tell<br>Why were you so surprised<br>That you never saw the stranger<br>Did you ever let your lover see<br>The stranger in yourself?</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to try again<br>Everyone goes south<br>Every now and then<br>You've done it why can't someone else?<br>You should know by now<br>You've been there yourself</p>
<p>You may never understand<br>How the stranger is inspired<br>But he isn't always evil<br>And he isn't always wrong<br>Though you drown in good intentions<br>You will never quench the fire<br>You'll give in to your desire<br>When the stranger comes along.</p>
