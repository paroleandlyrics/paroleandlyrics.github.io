          <p>Sitting here in Avalon, looking at the pouring rain<br>
Summer time has come and gone, and everybody’s home again<br>
Closing down for the season, I found the last of the souvenirs<br>
I can still taste the wedding cake and it’s sweet after all these years</p>
<p>These are the last words I have to say<br>
That’s why this took so long to write<br>
There will be other words some other day<br>
But that’s the story of my life</p>
<p>There’s comfort in my coffee cup and apples in the early fall<br>
They’re pulling all the moorings up and gathering at the Legion Hall<br>
They swept away all the streamers after the Labor Day parade<br>
Nothing left for a dreamer now, only one final serenade</p>
<p>And these are the last words I have to say<br>
Before another age goes by<br>
With all those other songs I’ll have to play<br>
But that’s the story of my life</p>
<p>And it’s so clear standing here where I am<br>
Ain’t that what justice is for?<br>
Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn anymore</p>
<p>Stack the chairs on the table tops<br>
Hang the sheets on the chandeliers<br>
It slows down but it never stops<br>
Ain’t it sweet after all these years</p>
<p>And these are the last words I have to say<br>
It’s always hard to say goodbye<br>
But now it’s time to put this book away<br>
Ain’t that the story of my life</p>
