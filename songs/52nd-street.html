          <p>They say it takes a lot to keep a love alive<br>In every heart there pumps a different beat<br>But if we shift the rhythm into overdrive<br>Well, we could generate a lot of heat<br>On Fifty Second Street<br>Oh oh Fifty Second Street</p>
<p>We're gonna have a little show parade<br>Before they know the second bar was played<br>We're gonna slip it to 'em short and sweet on Fifty Second Street</p>
