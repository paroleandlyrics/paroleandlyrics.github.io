          <p>Let me tell you a story<br>
About a woman and a man<br>
Maybe you will find familiar<br>
Maybe you won’t understand</p>
<p>The man’s name I don’t remember<br>
He was always Joe to me<br>
But I can’t forget the woman<br>
She was always Christie Lee</p>
<p>He was working in a night club<br>
That’s where he played the saxophone<br>
He used to fake stock arrangements<br>
He left the customers alone<br>
But one night before the last song<br>
About a quarter to three<br>
He saw her standing at the coat check</p>
<p>And made his move on Christie Lee<br>
Christie Lee, Christie Lee<br>
Christie Lee, Christie Lee</p>
<p>She was a nice piece of music<br>
She had a rhythm all her own<br>
He blew a solo like a blind man<br>
She really dug his saxophone<br>
She wanted more than just an encore<br>
And he could play in every key<br>
He left the stage and packed his alto<br>
And took it home with Christie Lee</p>
<p>Oh I heard the man knew “the Bird” like the bible<br>
You know the man could blow an educated axe<br>
He couldn’t see that Christie Lee was a woman<br>
Who didn’t need another lover<br>
All she wanted was the sax<br>
It took a while for him to notice<br>
It took a while for him to see<br>
He was never in control here<br>
It was always Christie Lee</p>
<p>Christie Lee, Christie Lee<br>
Christie Lee, Christie Lee</p>
<p>Oh the man took a calculated gamble<br>
Yes the man had the power to perform<br>
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle<br>
She didn’t need him as a man<br>
All she wanted was the horn</p>
<p>They say that Joe became a wino<br>
They say he always drinks alone<br>
They say he stumbles like a blind man<br>
They say he sold his saxophone</p>
<p>Even the band must face the music<br>
That’s what the moral is to me<br>
The only time you hit the high note<br>
Is when you play for Christie Lee</p>
<p>Christie Lee, Christie Lee<br>
Christie Lee, Christie Lee</p>
