          <p>While in these days of quiet desperation<br>
As I wander through the world in which I live<br>
I search everywhere for some new inspiration<br>
But it’s more than cold reality can give<br>
If I need a cause for celebration<br>
Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind<br>
I rely on my imagination<br>
And I dream of an imaginary time<br>
I know that everybody has a dream<br>
Everybody has a dream<br>
And this is my dream, my own<br>
Just to be at home<br>
And to be all alone…with you<br>
If I believe in all the words I’m saying<br>
And if a word from you can bring a better day<br>
Then all I have are these games that I’ve been playing<br>
To keep my hope from crumbling away<br>
So let me lie and let me go on sleeping<br>
And I will lose myself in palaces of sand<br>
And all the fantasies that I have been keeping<br>
Will make the empty hours easier to stand<br>
I know that everybody has a dream<br>
Everybody has a dream<br>
And this is my dream, my own<br>
Just to be at home<br>
And to be all alone…with you</p>
