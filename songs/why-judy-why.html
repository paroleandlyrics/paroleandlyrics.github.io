          <p>Of all the people in the world that I know<br>
You’re the best place to go when I cry, when I cry<br>
I never asked for much before, not before<br>
Things are changed: I need more<br>
Tell my why Judy why</p>
<p>I never thought that she would say, say goodbye<br>
But she did, and now I want to die, I want to die<br>
I never thought that I would need, need a friend<br>
Oh, but I did in the end<br>
Tell me why Judy why<br>
Oh, what a scene<br>
It’s wrong for her to hang me up this way<br>
Oh, where’ve you been?<br>
‘Cause it’s so hard to make it through the day<br>
A man my age is very young,<br>
So I’m told<br>
Why do I feel so old?<br>
Tell me why Judy why, Judy why</p>
<p>Oh what a scene<br>
It’s wrong for her to hang me up this way<br>
Oh, where’ve you been?<br>
‘Cause it’s so hard to make it through the day<br>
There’s no tomorrow,<br>
‘Cause my dream did not last<br>
So I live in the past<br>
Tell me why Judy why<br>
Tell me why Judy why<br>
Oh, tell me why Judy why</p>
