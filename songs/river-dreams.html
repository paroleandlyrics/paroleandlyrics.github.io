          <p>In the middle of the night<br>I go walking in my sleep<br>From the mountains of faith<br>To a river so deep<br>I must be looking for something<br>Something sacred I lost<br>But the river is wide<br>And it's too hard to cross</p>
<p>And even though I know the river is wide<br>I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore<br>And try to cross to the opposite side<br>So I can finally find out what I've been looking for</p>
<p>In the middle of the night<br>I go walking in my sleep<br>Through the valley of fear<br>To a river so deep<br>And I've been searching for something<br>Taken out of my soul<br>Something I would never lose<br>Something somebody stole</p>
<p>I don't know why I go walking at night<br>But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore<br>I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life<br>Until I find what it is that I've been looking for</p>
<p>In the middle of the night<br>I go walking in my sleep<br>Through the jungle of doubt<br>To a river so deep<br>I know I'm searching for something<br>Something so undefined<br>That it can only be seen<br>By the eyes of the blind<br>In the middle of the night</p>
<p>I'm not sure about a life after this<br>God knows I've never been a spiritual man<br>Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river<br>That runs to the promised land<br>In the middle of the night<br>I go walking in my sleep<br>Through the desert of truth<br>To the river so deep<br>We all end in the ocean<br>We all start in the streams<br>We're all carried along<br>By the river of dreams<br>In the middle of the night</p>
