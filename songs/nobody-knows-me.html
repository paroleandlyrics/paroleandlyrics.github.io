          <p>I got a friend that nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows but me<br>
I got a friend that nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows but me<br>
Oh, Mama thinks I’m talking to myself again<br>
I know she thinks I’m out of my mind<br>
But I’m really talking to my secret friend<br>
We get along just fine</p>
<p>I got a friend that nobody hears<br>
Nobody hears but me<br>
I got a friend that nobody hears<br>
Nobody hears but me<br>
Oh, I always go to sleep when my Daddy says<br>
I kiss him and turn out the light<br>
But my friend is sitting on the edge of the bed<br>
Talking to me every night</p>
<p>Everybody says it’s just a stage I’m in<br>
Everybody says I’m just a kid<br>
But they’ve never traveled to the places I’ve been<br>
Or done the crazy things that my friend and I did</p>
<p>Well, I got a friend that nobody sees<br>
Nobody sees but me<br>
I got a friend that nobody sees<br>
Nobody sees but me</p>
<p>I got a friend that nobody knows<br>
Nobody knows but me<br>
I got a friend that nobody knows<br>
Nobody hears<br>
Nobody sees<br>
Nobody’s spoken to<br>
And nobody can<br>
Nobody knows but me!</p>
