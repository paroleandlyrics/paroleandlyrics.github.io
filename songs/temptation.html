          <p>It's time for me to be on my way I know<br>
I've got business to conduct and I've got places to go<br>
But I can't help looking at her sleeping instead<br>
Another morning I'll have trouble climbing out of this bed<br>
Because – she's such a temptation<br>
It's driving me crazy<br>
And it's my fascination that's making me act this way<br>
And I know what all of my friends say<br>
They're afraid that I'm losing my touch<br>
But she's such a temptation</p>
<p>I look so tired 'cause I don't get much sleep<br>
And I've got too many commitments that are too hard too keep<br>
And I try to be rational and I try to be wise<br>
But it all gets blown to pieces when I look in her eyes<br>
Because – she's such a temptation<br>
And nothing can save me<br>
Any my only salvation is tearing myself away<br>
I know what all of my friends say:<br>
There's a danger in wanting too much<br>
She's such a temptation</p>
<p>I should be leaving, but I can't cut it loose<br>
I have my reasons for resistance, but I have no excuse<br>
And I lose my composure; I could use some restraint<br>
I never claimed to be a hero, and I never said I was a saint<br>
She's such a temptation<br>
And it's driving me crazy<br>
And it's my fascination that's making me act this way<br>
And I can just hear all my friends say:<br>
„Better watch out, you're losing your touch‰<br>
She's such a temptation<br>
Yes she is<br>
She's such a temptation<br>
Yes she is<br>
Yes she is<br>
She's such a temptation</p>
