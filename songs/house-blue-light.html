          <p>Well, I’m driving on down to the surfside bar<br>
These days my old shovelhead, she don’t travel far<br>
But she goes where I want and now I want to be<br>
Where all the locals go to keep each other company<br>
They all drive Chevy pick-ups in the morning<br>
They all ride Harley-Davidsons at night<br>
They all work for somebody<br>
Who makes all the money<br>
And pays them just enough to get tight<br>
In the House of Blue Light<br>
House of Blue Light</p>
<p>Well I’m driving on down to meet a woman there<br>
She got the long legs, the red lips and the golden hair<br>
She knows what to do to make a man feel good<br>
She’s the hardest working woman in this neighborhood<br>
She don’t mind making breakfast in the morning<br>
She don’t mind making love every night<br>
She says come see me honey<br>
And bring lots of money<br>
‘Cause we know how to treat you right<br>
At the House of Blue Light<br>
House of Blue Light<br>
House of Blue Light<br>
House of Blue Light</p>
<p>You know this life is filled with grief<br>
Sometimes it gets you so down<br>
You got to find yourself some kind of relief<br>
And there’s a roadhouse right outside of town<br>
Roadhouse of Blue Light</p>
<p>Well I’ve been around the world a dozen times or more<br>
And I never really knew what I was searching for<br>
Till I came to this place on a midnight ride<br>
I pulled next to a full dress Electra-Glide<br>
They had a band playing blues from Mississippi<br>
They had a bar that kept customers in sight<br>
They had some fine architecture<br>
And a view that would get you<br>
To want to spend the whole damn night<br>
In the House of Blue Light<br>
House of Blue Light<br>
House of Blue Light <br>
House of Blue Light</p>
