          <p>Some love is just a lie of the heart<br>
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start<br>
And they may not want it to end<br>
But it will, it’s just a question of when<br>
I’ve lived long enough to have learned<br>
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned<br>
But that won’t happen to us<br>
Because it’s always been a matter of trust</p>
<p>I know you’re an emotional girl<br>
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world<br>
I can’t offer you proof<br>
But you’re gonna face a moment of truth<br>
It’s hard when you’re always afraid<br>
You just recover when another belief is betrayed<br>
So break my heart if you must<br>
It’s a matter of trust</p>
<p>You can’t go the distance<br>
With too much resistance<br>
I know you have doubts<br>
But for God’s sake don’t shut me out</p>
<p>This time you’ve got nothing to lose<br>
You can take it, you can leave it<br>
Whatever you choose<br>
I won’t hold back anything<br>
And I’ll walk away a fool or a king<br>
Some love is just a lie of the mind<br>
It’s make believe until it’s only a matter of time<br>
And some might have learned to adjust<br>
But then it never was a matter of trust</p>
<p>I’m sure you’re aware love<br>
We’ve both had our share of<br>
Believing too long<br>
When the whole situation was wrong</p>
<p>Some love is just a lie of the soul<br>
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control<br>
After you’ve heard lie upon lie<br>
There can hardly be a question of why<br>
Some love is just a lie of the heart<br>
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start<br>
But that can’t happen to us<br>
Because it’s always been a matter of trust</p>
