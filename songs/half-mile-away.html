          <p>Little Geo is a friend of mine<br>
We get some money and we buy a cheap wine<br>
Sit on the corner and have a holiday<br>
Hide the bottle when the cop goes by<br>
Talk about women and lie, lie, lie<br>
Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away</p>
<p>Wait for mamma to turn out the light<br>
Crawl on the the roof and then hit the night<br>
I should be sleeping but tonight I just can’t stay<br>
I’ve given everybody so much time<br>
Now I need a moment that’s mine<br>
Oh my other world is just a half a mile away</p>
<p>It’s just a half a mile away</p>
<p>Angelina save a place for me<br>
I’ve been livin’ someone else’s life and now I’ve got to be free<br>
Turn your transistor on and let the music play<br>
I try to keep the family satisfied<br>
But there’s gotta be more to life than just try, try, try<br>
Oh my other world is just a half a mile away</p>
<p>It’s just a half a mile away</p>
