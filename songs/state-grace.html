          <p>There you go, slipping away into a state of grace<br>
I know the look that comes across your face<br>
It’s so familiar to me<br>
Here I am, trying to keep you in my line of sight<br>
I’m never certain that you read me right<br>
Sometimes you don’t want to see<br>
Here we are, both of us know we’re in love<br>
But that isn’t always enough<br>
I never could rise above it all, down I fall</p>
<p>But darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace<br>
Granted, this world is not a perfect place<br>
Still it’s the world that I’m in<br>
Here I am talking while you don’t hear a word I say<br>
Knowing you’re watching me from far away<br>
Somewhere that I’ve never been</p>
<p>Don’t you see, you lived a different life than me<br>
It doesn’t mean you have to be afraid of how<br>
We’re not the same, don’t leave me now</p>
<p>But darling there you go, slipping away</p>
<p>How can I get you to stay where you are<br>
Keep you for going too far<br>
Holding you here is so hard to do…I’m losing you</p>
<p>And darling there you go, slipping away into a state of grace<br>
Drifting away into your sacred place<br>
Someplace that I’ve never been<br>
There you go, slipping away, slipping away, into a state of grace<br>
There you go, slipping away into a state of grace<br>
There you go…drifting away…</p>
