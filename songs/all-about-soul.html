          <p>She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence<br>
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain<br>
And so far she hasn’t run, though I swear she’s had her moments<br>
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain</p>
<p>It’s all about soul<br>
It’s all about faith and a deeper devotion<br>
It’s all about soul<br>
‘Cause under the love is a stronger emotion<br>
She’s got to be strong<br>
‘Cause so many things getting out of control<br>
Should drive her away<br>
So why does she stay?<br>
It’s all about soul</p>
<p>She turns to me sometimes and she asks me what I’m dreaming<br>
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away<br>
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me at that moment<br>
And she smiles because it’s understood there are no words to say</p>
<p>It’s all about soul<br>
It’s all about knowing what someone is feeling<br>
The woman’s got soul<br>
The power of love and the power of healing<br>
This life isn’t fair<br>
It’s gonna get dark, it’s gonna get cold<br>
You’ve got to get tough, but that ain’t enough<br>
It’s all about soul</p>
<p>There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness<br>
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive<br>
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires<br>
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive</p>
<p>It’s all about soul<br>
It’s all about joy that comes out of sorrow<br>
It’s all about soul<br>
Who’s standing now and who’s standing tomorrow<br>
You’ve got to be hard<br>
Hard as the rock in that old rock ‘n roll<br>
But that’s only part, you know in your heart<br>
It’s all about soul</p>
