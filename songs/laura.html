          <p>Laura<br>
Calls me<br>
In the middle of the night</p>
<p>Passes on her<br>
Painful information<br>
Then these careless fingers<br>
They get caught in her vice</p>
<p>Til they’re bleeding<br>
On my coffee table<br>
Living alone isn’t all that<br>
It’s cracked up to be</p>
<p>I’m on her side<br>
Why does she push the poison on me?</p>
<p>Laura<br>
Has a very hard time<br>
All her life has<br>
Been one long disaster<br>
Then she tells me<br>
She suddenly believes she’s seen<br>
A very good sign<br>
She’ll be taking<br>
Some aggressive action<br>
I fight her wars<br>
While she’s slamming her doors<br>
In my face</p>
<p>Failure to break<br>
Was the only mistake<br>
That she made</p>
<p>Here I am<br>
Feeling like a fucking fool<br>
Do I react the way exactly<br>
She intends me to?</p>
<p>Everytime I think I’m off the hook<br>
She makes me lose my cool<br>
I’m her machine<br>
And she can punch all the keys<br>
And she can push any button I was programmed through</p>
<p>Laura<br>
Calls me<br>
When she needs a good fix<br>
All her questions<br>
Will get sympathetic answers<br>
I should<br>
Be so<br>
Immunized<br>
To all of her tricks</p>
<p>She’s surviving<br>
On her second chances<br>
Sometimes I feel like this<br>
Godfather deal is all wrong</p>
<p>How can she hold an umbilical chord<br>
For so long?</p>
<p>I’ve done everything I can<br>
What else am I supposed to do<br>
I’m her machine<br>
And she can punch all the keys<br>
And she can push any button<br>
I was programmed through</p>
<p>Laura<br>
Loves me<br>
Even if I don’t care</p>
<p>That’s my problem<br>
That’s her sacred absolution<br>
If she had to<br>
She would put herself in my chair<br>
Even though I<br>
Faced electrocution<br>
She always says<br>
I’m the best friend that<br>
She’s ever had</p>
<p>How do you<br>
Hang up on someone<br>
Who needs you that bad?</p>
