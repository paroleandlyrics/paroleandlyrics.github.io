          <p>If it seems like I’ve been lost<br>
In let’s remember<br>
If you think I’m feeling older<br>
And missing my younger days<br>
Oh, then you should have known me much better<br>
‘Cause my past is something that never<br>
Got in my way<br>
Oh no</p>
<p>Still I would not be here now<br>
If I never had the hunger<br>
And I’m not ashamed to say<br>
The wild boys were my friends<br>
Oh<br>
‘Cause I never felt the desire<br>
‘Til their music set me on fire<br>
And then I was saved, yeah<br>
That’s why I’m keeping the faith<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Keeping the faith</p>
<p>We wore old matador boots<br>
Only Flagg Brothers had them with a Cuban heel<br>
Iridescent socks with the same color shirt<br>
And a tight pair of chinos<br>
Oh<br>
I put on my shark skin jacket<br>
You know the kind with the velvet collar<br>
And ditty-bop shades<br>
Oh yeah<br>
I took a fresh pack of Luckies<br>
And a mint called Sen-Sen<br>
My old man’s Trojans<br>
And his Old Spice after shave<br>
Oh<br>
Combed my hair in a pompadour<br>
Like the rest of the Romeos wore<br>
A permanent wave, Yeah<br>
We were keeping the faith<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Keeping the faith<br>
You can get just so much<br>
From a good thing<br>
You can linger too long<br>
In your dreams<br>
Say goodbye to the<br>
Oldies but goodies<br>
‘Cause the good ole days weren’t<br>
Always good<br>
And tomorrow ain’t as bad as it seems</p>
<p>Learned stickball as a formal education<br>
Lost a lot of fights<br>
But it taught me how to lose O.K.<br>
Oh, I heard about sex<br>
But not enough<br>
I found you could dance<br>
And still look tough anyway<br>
Oh yes I did<br>
I found out a man ain’t just being macho<br>
Ate an awful lot of late night drive-in food Drank a lot of take home pay<br>
I thought I was the Duke of Earl<br>
When I made it with a red-haired girl<br>
In the Chevrolet. Oh yeah<br>
We were keeping the faith<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Keeping the faith</p>
<p>You know the good ole days weren’t always good<br>
And tomorrow ain’t as bad as it seems</p>
<p>I told you my reasons<br>
For the whole revival<br>
Now I’m going outside to have<br>
An ice cold beer in the shade<br>
Oh, I’m going to listen to my 45’s<br>
Ain’t it wonderful to be alive<br>
When the rock ‘n’ roll plays, yeah<br>
When the memory stays, yeah<br>
I’m keeping the faith<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Keeping the faith<br>
I’m keeping the faith,<br>
Yes I am</p>
