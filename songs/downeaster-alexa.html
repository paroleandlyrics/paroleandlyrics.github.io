          <p>Well I'm on the Downeaster Alexa<br>And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound<br>I have charted a course to the Vineyard<br>But tonight I am Nantucket bound</p>
<p>We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday<br>And left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay<br>Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home<br>Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone</p>
<p>So I could own my Downeaster Alexa<br>And I go where the ocean is deep<br>There are giants out there in the canyons<br>And a good captain can't fall asleep</p>
<p>I've got bills to pay and children who need clothes<br>I know there's fish out there but where God only knows<br>They say these waters aren't what they used to be<br>But I've got people back on land who count on me</p>
<p>So if you see my Downeaster Alexa<br>And if you work with the rod and the reel<br>Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis<br>And I still have my hands on the wheel</p>
<p>Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa<br>More and more miles from shore every year<br>Since they tell me I can't sell no stripers<br>And there's no luck in swordfishing here</p>
<p>I was a bayman like my father was before<br>Can't make a living as a bayman anymore<br>There ain't much future for a man who works the sea<br>But there ain't no island left for islanders like me</p>
