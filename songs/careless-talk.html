          <p>Careless talk<br>
That’s what you heard about me<br>
Jealous talk<br>
That’s what I heard about you<br>
Everybody’s telling lies<br>
I don’t even know why<br>
Why can’t people<br>
Find something better to do</p>
<p>Careless talk<br>
I don’t believe what they say<br>
I heard them talk<br>
They say you’ve been putting me down</p>
<p>In the shadows on the phone<br>
They won’t leave us alone<br>
They’ve been talking<br>
Ever since you came around</p>
<p>Careless talk<br>
Telling you I’m doing wrong<br>
Jealous talk<br>
Follows wherever you go</p>
<p>I’m aware of what you heard<br>
Every terrible word<br>
Everybody’s making believe that they know<br>
All of the intimate things<br>
That we might have said</p>
<p>In the heat of a passionate moment<br>
In a conversation shared<br>
For the ears of nobody else<br>
There are some things they will never hear<br>
There are secrets I’ll never tell<br>
Careless talk<br>
Going around on the street<br>
Jealous talk<br>
I know how bad it can be</p>
<p>Let them stand where they fall<br>
They don’t know us at all<br>
All that talking won’t make a difference to me</p>
