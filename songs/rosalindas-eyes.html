          <p>I play nights in the Spanish part of town<br>
I’ve got music in my hands<br>
The work is hard to find<br>
But that don’t get me down<br>
Rosalinda understands</p>
<p>Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square<br>
Oh Havana I’ve been searching for you everywhere<br>
And though I’ll never be there<br>
I know what I would see there<br>
I can always find my Cuban skies<br>
In Rosalinda’s eyes</p>
<p>When she smiles she gives everything to me<br>
When she’s all alone she cries<br>
And I’d do anything to take away her tears<br>
Because they’re Rosalinda’s eyes</p>
<p>Senorita don’t be lonely, I will soon be there<br>
Oh Havana I’ve been searching for you everywhere<br>
I’ve got a chance to make it<br>
It’s time for me to take it<br>
I’ll return before the fire dies<br>
In Rosalinda’s eyes</p>
<p>All alone in a Puerto Rican band<br>
Union wages, wedding clothes<br>
Hardly anyone has seen how good I am<br>
But Rosalinda says she knows</p>
<p>Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square<br>
Oh Havana I’ve been searching for you everywhere<br>
And though I’ll never be there<br>
I know what I would see there<br>
I can always find my Cuban skies<br>
In Rosalinda’s eyes</p>
