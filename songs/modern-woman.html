          <p>You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper<br>
With her high top sneakers of Italian design<br>
With a long cool stare she aggravates the tension<br>
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind</p>
<p>Now you’re in trouble, maybe she’s an intellectual<br>
What if she figures out you’re not very smart<br>
Or maybe she’s the quiet type who’s into heavy metal<br>
Boy, you got to get it settled<br>
Cause she’s breaking your heart</p>
<p>Don’t try to put on an act<br>
You can’t do that to a modern woman<br>
And you’re an old fashioned man<br>
She understands the things you’re doin’<br>
She’s a modern woman</p>
<p>She looks sleek and she seems so professional<br>
She’s got a lot of confidence, it’s easy to see<br>
You want to make a move<br>
But you feel so inferior<br>
Cause under that exterior<br>
Is someone who’s free</p>
<p>She’s got style and she’s got her own money<br>
So she’s not another honey you can quickly disarm<br>
She’s got the eyes that make you realize<br>
She won’t be hypnotized by your usual charm</p>
<p>You’ve got your plan of attack<br>
That won’t attract the modern woman<br>
When you’re an old fashioned man<br>
She understands the things you’re doin’<br>
She’s a modern woman</p>
<p>The time goes by and you’re sharing an apartment<br>
She says she loves you but she doesn’t know why<br>
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and paper<br>
It’s a strange situation for an old fashioned guy</p>
<p>But times have changed<br>
Things are not the same, baby<br>
You overcame such a bad attitude<br>
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks<br>
And nowadays it’s politics<br>
And after 1986 what else could be new</p>
<p>You got to learn to relax<br>
And face the facts of modern woman<br>
And you’re an old fashioned man<br>
She understands the things you’re doin’<br>
She’s a modern woman</p>
