          <p>Call me a joker, call me a fool<br>
Right at this moment I’m totally cool<br>
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife<br>
I feel like I’m in the prime of my life<br>
Sometimes it feels like I’m going too fast<br>
I don’t know how long this feeling will last<br>
Maybe it’s only tonight</p>
<p>Darling I don’t know why I go to extremes<br>
Too high or too low there ain’t no in-betweens<br>
And if I stand or I fall<br>
It’s all or nothing at all<br>
Darling I don’t know why I go to extremes</p>
<p>Sometimes I’m tired, sometimes I’m shot<br>
Sometimes I don’t know how much more I’ve got<br>
Maybe I’m headed over the hill<br>
Maybe I’ve set myself up for the kill<br>
Tell me how much do you think you can take<br>
Until the heart in you is starting to break?<br>
Sometimes it feels like it will</p>
<p>Darling I don’t know why I go to extremes<br>
Too high or too low there ain’t no in-betweens<br>
You can be sure when I’m gone<br>
I won’t be out there too long<br>
Darling I don’t know why I go to extremes</p>
<p>Out of the darkness, into the light<br>
Leaving the scene of the crime<br>
Either I’m wrong or I’m perfectly right every time<br>
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night<br>
Coming apart at the seams<br>
Eager to please, ready to fight<br>
Why do I go to extremes?</p>
<p>Darling I don’t know why I go to extremes<br>
Too high or too low there ain’t no in-betweens<br>
And if I stand or I fall<br>
It’s all or nothing at all<br>
Darling I don’t know why I go to extremes<br>
No I don’t know why I go to extremes<br>
Too high or too low there ain’t no in-betweens<br>
You can be sure when I’m gone<br>
I won’t be out there too long<br>
Darling I don’t know why I go to extremes</p>
