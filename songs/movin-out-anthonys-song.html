          <p>Anthony works in the grocery store<br>
savin’ his pennies for someday<br>
Mama Leone left a note on the door,<br>
she said<br>
“Sonny, move out to the country”<br>
Workin’ too hard can give me<br>
a heart attack<br>
You oughta know by now<br>
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?<br>
Is that what you get with your money?</p>
<p>*It seems such a waste of time<br>
If that’s what it’s all about<br>
If that’s movin’ up then I’m movin’ out.</p>
<p>Sergeant O’Leary is walkin’ the beat<br>
At night he becomes a bartender<br>
He works at Mister Cacciatore’s down<br>
on Sullivan Street<br>
Across from the medical center<br>
He’s tradin’ in his Chevy for a Cadillac<br>
You oughta know by now<br>
And if he can’t drive with<br>
a broken back<br>
At least he can polish the fenders</p>
<p>*It seems such a waste of time<br>
If that’s what it’s all about<br>
If that’s movin’ up then I’m movin’ out.</p>
<p>You should never argue with a crazy mind<br>
You oughta know by now<br>
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime<br>
Is that all you get for your money?</p>
<p>*It seems such a waste of time<br>
If that’s what it’s all about<br>
If that’s movin’ up then I’m <br>
movin’ out.</p>
