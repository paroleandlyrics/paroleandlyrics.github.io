          <p>In every heart there is a room<br>
A sanctuary safe and strong<br>
To heal the wounds from lovers past<br>
Until a new one comes along</p>
<p>I spoke to you in cautious tones<br>
You answered me with no pretense<br>
And still I feel I said too much<br>
My silence is my self defense</p>
<p>And every time I’ve held a rose<br>
It seems I only felt the thorns<br>
And so it goes, and so it goes<br>
And so will you soon I suppose</p>
<p>But if my silence made you leave<br>
Then that would be my worst mistake<br>
So I will share this room with you<br>
And you can have this heart to break</p>
<p>And this is why my eyes are closed<br>
It’s just as well for all I’ve seen<br>
And so it goes, and so it goes<br>
And you’re the only one who knows</p>
<p>So I would choose to be with you<br>
That’s if the choice were mine to make<br>
But you can make decisions too<br>
And you can have this heart to break</p>
<p>And so it goes, and so it goes<br>
And you’re the only one who knows</p>
