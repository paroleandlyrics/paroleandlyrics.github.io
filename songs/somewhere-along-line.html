          <p>Well, it’s a rainy night in Paris,<br>
And I’m sitting by the Seine,<br>
It’s a pleasure to be soaking in the European rain,<br>
Now my belly’s full of fancy food and wine<br>
Oh but in the morning there’ll be hell to pay<br>
Somewhere along the line<br>
In the morning there’ll be hell to pay<br>
Somewhere along the line</p>
<p>Sweet Virginia cigarette burnin’ in my hand<br>
Well you used to be a friend of mine but now I understand<br>
You’ve been eating up inside me for some time<br>
Oh and I know you’re gonna get me<br>
Somewhere along the line<br>
Well I know you’re gonna get me<br>
Somewhere along the line<br>
Somewhere along the line<br>
Well I know it’s just a matter of time<br>
Well the fun falls through and the rent comes due<br>
Somewhere along the line</p>
<p>Well you know I love my woman,<br>
And I would not let her down,<br>
And I did my share of lovin’ when I used to get around<br>
Now I’m satisfied,<br>
And she is lookin’ fine<br>
Oh but you pay for your satisfaction<br>
Somewhere along the line<br>
But you pay for your satisfaction<br>
Somewhere along the line</p>
<p>Hey it’s good to be a young man<br>
And to live the way you please<br>
Yes a young man is the king of ev’ry kingdom that he sees<br>
But there’s an old and feeble man not far behind<br>
Oh that surely will catch up to him<br>
Somewhere along the line<br>
That surely will catch up to him<br>
Somewhere along the line</p>
