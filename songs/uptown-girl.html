          <p>Uptown girl<br>
She’s been living in her uptown world<br>
I bet she never had a backstreet guy<br>
I bet her mama never told her why</p>
<p>I’m gonna try for an uptown girl<br>
She’s been living in her white bread world<br>
As long as anyone with hot blood can<br>
And now she’s looking for a downtown man<br>
That’s what I am</p>
<p>And when she knows what<br>
She wants from her time<br>
And when she wakes up<br>
And makes up her mind</p>
<p>She’ll see I’m not so tough<br>
Just because<br>
I’m in love with an uptown girl</p>
<p>You know I’ve seen her in her uptown world<br>
She’s getting tired of her high class toys<br>
And all her presents from her uptown boys<br>
She’s got a choice</p>
<p>Uptown girl<br>
You know I can’t afford to buy her pearls<br>
But maybe someday when my ship comes in<br>
She’ll understand what kind of guy I’ve been<br>
And then I’ll win</p>
<p>And when she’s walking<br>
She’s looking so fine<br>
And when she’s talking<br>
She’ll say that she’s mine</p>
<p>She’ll say I’m not so tough<br>
Just because<br>
I’m in love<br>
With and uptown girl</p>
<p>She’s been living in her white bread world<br>
As long as anyone with hot blood can<br>
And now she’s looking for a downtown man<br>
That’s what I am</p>
<p>Uptown girl<br>
She’s my uptown girl<br>
You know I’m in love<br>
With an uptown girl<br>
My uptown girl<br>
You know I’m in love<br>
With an uptown girl<br>
My uptown girl</p>
