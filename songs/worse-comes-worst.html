          <p>Today I'm livin' like a rich man's son<br>Tomorrow mornin' I could be a bum<br>It doesn't matter which direction though<br>I know a woman in New Mexico<br>Oh worse comes to worse I'll get along</p>
<p>I don't know how but sometimes I can be strong<br>And if I don't have a car I'll hitch<br>I got a thumb and she's a son of a bitch<br>I'll do my writing on my road guitar<br>And make a living at a piano bar<br>Oh worse comes to worse I'll get along<br>I don't know how but sometimes I can be strong</p>
<p>Oo lighting and thunder<br>Flashed across the roads we drove up on<br>Oh but it's clear skies we're under<br>When we are together, when I sing my song</p>
<p>Fun ain't easy if it ain’t free<br>Too many people got a hold on me<br>But I know a woman in New Mexico<br>Oh worse comes to worse I'll get along<br>I don't know how but sometimes I can be strong</p>
