          <p>I never ask you where you go<br>
After I leave you in the morning<br>
We go our different ways to separate situations<br>
It’s not that easy anymore</p>
<p>Today I do what must be done<br>
I give my time to total strangers<br>
But now it feels as though the the day goes on forever<br>
More than it ever did before</p>
<p>Until the night, until the night<br>
I just might make it<br>
Until the night, until the night<br>
When I see you again</p>
<p>Now you’re afraid that we have changed<br>
And I’m afraid we’re getting older<br>
So many broken hearts, so many lonely faces<br>
So many lovers come and gone</p>
<p>I’ll have my fears like every man<br>
You’ll have you tears like every woman<br>
Today we’ll be unsure, is this what we believe in<br>
And wonder how can we go wrong</p>
<p>Until the night, until the night<br>
I just might make it<br>
Until the night, until the night<br>
When I see you again</p>
<p>When the sun goes down<br>
And the day is over<br>
When the last of the light has gone<br>
As they pour into the street<br>
I will be getting closer<br>
As the cars turn their headlights on<br>
As they’re closing it down<br>
I’m gonna open it up<br>
And while they’re going to sleep<br>
We’ll just be starting to touch<br>
I’m just beginning to feel<br>
I’m just beginning to give<br>
I’m just beginning to feel<br>
I’m just beginning to live<br>
Before I leave you again<br>
Before the light of dawn<br>
Before this evening can end<br>
I have been waiting so long</p>
<p>Until the night, until the night<br>
I just might make it<br>
Until the night, until the night<br>
I’ll just keep holding on<br>
Until the night, until the night<br>
When I see you again</p>
