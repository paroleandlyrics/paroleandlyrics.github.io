          <p>Flyin' east on a plane drinkin' all that free champagne<br>I guess I saw this comin' down the line<br>And I know it should be fun, but I think I should've packed my gun<br>Got that old suburban showdown in my mind<br>Sit around with the folks, tell the same old jokes,<br>Bored to death on Sunday afternoon<br>Mom and Dad, me and you and the outdoor barbecue<br>Think I'm gonna hide out in my room</p>
<p>I've been gone for a while, made some changes in my style<br>And they say you can't go home anymore<br>Well the streets all look the same, and I'll have to play the game<br>We'll all sit around in the kitchen chairs<br>With the TV on with the neighbors there</p>
<p>Out in the yard where my Daddy worked so hard<br>He never lets the crabgrass grow too high<br>Oh, the place hasn't changed<br>And that's why I'm gonna feel so strange<br>But I have to face the music bye and bye</p>
<p>I've been gone for a while, made some changes in my style<br>And they say you can't go home anymore<br>Well the streets all look the same,<br>And I'll have to play the game<br>We'll all sit around in the kitchen chairs<br>With the TV on with the neighbors there</p>
<p>We'll drive into town when this big bird touches down<br>I'm only comin' home to say goodbye<br>Then I'm gone with the wind and<br>I won't be seen again<br>Til that great suburban showdown in the sky<br>Til that great suburban showdown in the sky</p>
