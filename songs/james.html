          <p>James<br>
We were always friends from our childhood days<br>
And we made our plans<br>
And we had to go our sep’rate ways<br>
I went on the road<br>
You pursued an education</p>
<p>James<br>
Do you like your life<br>
Can you find release<br>
And will you ever change<br>
Will you ever write your masterpiece?</p>
<p>Are you still in school<br>
Living up to expectations?<br>
James<br>
You were so relied upon<br>
Ev’rybody knows how hard you tried</p>
<p>Hey<br>
Oh, look at what a job you’ve done<br>
Carrying the weight of fam’ly pride</p>
<p>James<br>
You’ve been well behaved, you’ve been working hard<br>
But will you always stay<br>
Someone else’s dream of who you are?<br>
Do what’s good for you<br>
Or you’re not good for anybody<br>
James</p>
<p>I went on the road<br>
You pursued an education<br>
James<br>
How you gonna know for sure<br>
Ev’rything was so well organized</p>
<p>Hey,<br>
Oh, now ev’rything is so secure<br>
And ev’rybody else is satisfied<br>
James<br>
Do you like your life<br>
Can you find release<br>
And will you ever change<br>
When will you write your masterpiece?<br>
Do what’s good for you<br>
Or you’re not good for anybody<br>
James</p>
