          <p>In the beginning<br>
There was the cold and the night<br>
Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light<br>
Man was triumphant<br>
Armed with the faith and the will<br>
That even the darkest ages couldn’t kill</p>
<p>Too many kingdoms<br>
Too many flags on the field<br>
So many battles, so many wounds to be healed<br>
Time is relentless<br>
Only true love perseveres<br>
It’s been a long time and now I’m with you<br>
After two thousand years</p>
<p>This is our moment<br>
Here at the crossroads of time<br>
We hope our children carry our dreams down the line<br>
They are the vintage<br>
What kind of life will they live?<br>
Is this a curse or a blessing that we give?</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder<br>
Why are we so blind to fate?<br>
Without compassion, there can be no end to hate<br>
No end to sorrow<br>
Caused by the same endless fears<br>
Why can’t we learn from all we’ve been through<br>
After two thousand years?</p>
<p>There will be miracles<br>
After the last war is won<br>
Science and poetry rule in the new world to come<br>
Prophets and angels<br>
Gave us the power to see<br>
What an amazing future there will be<br>
And in the evening<br>
After the fire and the light<br>
One thing is certain: nothing can hold back the night<br>
Time is relentless<br>
And as the past disappears<br>
We’re on the verge of all things new<br>
We are two thousand years</p>
