          <p>Late at night<br>
When it’s dark and cold<br>
I reach out<br>
For someone to hold<br>
When I’m blue<br>
When I’m lonely<br>
She comes through<br>
She’s the only one who can<br>
My baby grand<br>
Is all I need</p>
<p>In my time<br>
I’ve wandered everywhere<br>
Around this world<br>
She would always be there<br>
Any day<br>
Any hour<br>
All it takes<br>
Is the power in my hands<br>
This baby grand’s<br>
Been good to me</p>
<p>I’ve had friends<br>
But they slipped away<br>
I’ve had fame<br>
But it doesn’t stay<br>
I’ve made fortunes<br>
Spent them fast enough<br>
As for women<br>
They don’t last with just one man<br>
But baby grand<br>
Will stand by me</p>
<p>They say that no one’s gonna play this on the radio<br>
They said the melancholy blues were dead and gone<br>
But only songs like these<br>
Played in minor keys<br>
Keep those memories holding on</p>
<p>I’ve come far<br>
From the life I strayed in<br>
I’ve got scars<br>
From those dives I played in<br>
Now I’m home<br>
And I’m weary<br>
In my bones<br>
Every dreary one night stand<br>
But baby grand<br>
Came home with me</p>
<p>Ever since this gig began<br>
My baby grand’s<br>
Been good to me</p>
