          <p>I’ve seen those big machines come rolling through the quiet pines<br>
Blue suits and bankers with their Volvos and their valentines<br>
Give us this day our daily discount outlet merchandise<br>
Raise up a multiplex and we will make a sacrifice<br>
Now we’re gonna get the big business<br>
Now we’re gonna get the real thing<br>
Everybody’s all excited about it</p>
<p>Who remembers when it all began – out here in No Man’s Land<br>
Before they passed the master plan – out here in No Man’s Land<br>
Low supply and high demand – here in No Man’s Land</p>
<p>There ain’t much work out here in our consumer power base<br>
No major industry, just miles and miles of parking space<br>
This morning’s paper says our neighbor’s in a cocaine bust<br>
Lots more to read about Lolita and suburban lust<br>
Now we’re gonna get the whole story<br>
Now we’re gonna be in prime time<br>
Everybody’s all excited about it</p>
<p>Who remembers when it all began – out here in No Man’s Land<br>
We’ve just begun to understand – out here in No Man’s Land<br>
Low supply and high demand – here in No Man’s Land</p>
<p>I see these children with their boredom and their vacant stares<br>
God help us all if we’re to blame for their unanswered prayers<br>
They roll the sidewalks up at night this place goes underground<br>
Thanks to the Condo Kings there’s cable now in Zombietown<br>
Now we’re gonna get the closed circuit<br>
Now we’re gonna get the Top 40<br>
Now we’re gonna get the sports franchise<br>
Now we’re gonna get the major attractions</p>
<p>Who remembers when it all began – out here in No Man’s Land<br>
Before the whole world was in our hands – out here in No Man’s Land<br>
Before the banners and the marching bands – out here in No Man’s Land<br>
Low supply and high demand – here in No Man’s Land</p>
