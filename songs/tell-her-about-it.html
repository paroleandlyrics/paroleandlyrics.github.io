          <p>Listen boy<br>
Don’t want to see you let a good thing<br>
Slip away<br>
You know I don’t like watching<br>
Anybody make the same mistakes<br>
I made</p>
<p>She’s a real nice girl<br>
And she’s always there for you<br>
But a nice girl wouldn’t tell you what you should do</p>
<p>Listen boy<br>
I’m sure that you think you got it all<br>
Under control</p>
<p>You don’t want somebody telling you<br>
The way to stay in someone’s soul</p>
<p>You’re a big boy now<br>
You’ll never let her go<br>
But that’s just the kind of thing<br>
She ought to know</p>
<p>Tell her about it<br>
Tell her everything you feel<br>
Give her every reason to accept<br>
That you’re for real</p>
<p>Tell her about it<br>
Tell her all your crazy dreams<br>
Let her know you need her<br>
Let her know how much she means</p>
<p>Listen boy<br>
It’s not automatically a certain guarantee<br>
To insure yourself<br>
You’ve got to provide communication constantly</p>
<p>When you love someone<br>
You’re always insecure<br>
And there’s only one good way<br>
To reassure</p>
<p>Tell her about it<br>
Let her know how much you care<br>
When she can’t be with you<br>
Tell her you wish you were there<br>
Tell her about it<br>
Every day before you leave<br>
Pay her some attention<br>
Give her something to believe</p>
<p>Cause now and then<br>
She’ll get to worrying<br>
Just because you haven’t spoken<br>
For so long<br>
Though you may not have done anything<br>
Will that be a consolation when she’s gone</p>
<p>Listen boy<br>
It’s good information from a man<br>
Who’s made mistakes<br>
Just a word or two that she gets from you<br>
Could be the difference that it makes</p>
<p>She’s a trusting soul<br>
She’s put her trust in you<br>
But a girl like that won’t tell you<br>
What you should do</p>
<p>Tell her about it<br>
Tell her everything you feel<br>
Give her every reason<br>
To accept that you’re for real<br>
Tell her about it<br>
Tell her all your crazy dreams<br>
Let her know you need her<br>
Let her know how much she means</p>
<p>Tell her about it<br>
Tell her how you feel right now<br>
Tell her about it<br>
The girl don’t want to wait too long<br>
You got to tell her about it<br>
Tell her now and you won’t go wrong<br>
You got to tell her about it<br>
Before it gets too late<br>
You got to tell her about it<br>
You know the girl don’t want<br>
To wait – you got to<br>
Tell her about it</p>
