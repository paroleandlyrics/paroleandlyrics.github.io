          <p>Well if money makes a rich man<br>
Then I might never make the grade<br>
I’ll be a small time operator<br>
If I just get the landlord paid<br>
But if time is an indication<br>
Of the wealth that I never knew<br>
Then I’m the last of the big time spenders<br>
‘Cause I’ve been spendin’ time on you<br>
(Woo oo oo woo woo)</p>
<p>It takes time to appreciate<br>
Lord knows that you can learn to hate it<br>
I believe, ’cause I’ve been there too<br>
When it gets down to desperation<br>
You make the best of the situation<br>
I can tell, I’ve seen it thru<br>
(Oh, ohoh)</p>
<p>Tho’ it seems like the days were wasted<br>
And the nights have been overdue<br>
Well, I’m the last of the big time spenders<br>
And I’ve been spendin’ time on you</p>
<p>It’s been so long since we got together<br>
In between it seems to take forever<br>
But I’m a dreamer, I’ll be there soon<br>
It takes time to appreciate<br>
All of those that you can learn to hate<br>
I believe, I’ve seen it thru<br>
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)</p>
<p>You can call me the Great Pretender<br>
And in a way it might be true<br>
But I’m the last of the big time spenders<br>
And I’ve been spendin’ time on you<br>
(Woo oo oo woo woo)</p>
