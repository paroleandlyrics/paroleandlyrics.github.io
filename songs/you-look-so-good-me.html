          <p>Ah, you look so good to me<br>
With my eyes open wide I can see<br>
Ah, you feel so good to me<br>
And it’s so good when you’re here<br>
‘Cause I’m free<br>
I’m feelin’ the glory from that smile upon your face<br>
You lifted me high above my ordinary place, uh huh<br>
And I am so happy when I’m in your warm embrace, yeah yeah<br>
Woh, woh</p>
<p>Ah, you look so good to me<br>
With my eyes open wide I can see<br>
Ah, you feel so good to me<br>
And who knows what your next move will be</p>
<p>Ah, you look so good to me<br>
With my eyes open wide I can see<br>
Ah, you feel so good to me<br>
And it’s so good when you’re here, cause I’m free</p>
