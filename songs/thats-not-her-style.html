          <p>Some people think that she’s one of those mink-coated ladies<br>
They say she wakes up at one<br>
And she makes the paparazzi run till dawn<br>
She wines and dines with Argentines and Kuwaitis<br>
After she sips margaritas on the White House lawn</p>
<p>That’s not her style I can tell you<br>
That ain’t my woman<br>
It’s just not her style I can tell you<br>
Because I’m her man</p>
<p>The papers say she was seen in LA with a stranger<br>
She found a perfect body with Maserati right outside<br>
And then she chartered a Lear<br>
When she heard her career was in danger<br>
And gave the pilot somethin’ extra for a perfect ride</p>
<p>That’s not her style I can tell you<br>
That ain’t my woman<br>
That’s not her style I can tell you<br>
Because I’m her man</p>
<p>That’s not her style I can tell you<br>
That ain’t my woman<br>
It’s just not her style I can tell you<br>
Because I’m her man</p>
<p>Not that she’s never done something crazy or done something wild<br>
It’s just that she’s better at doing whatever suits her style<br>
And that’s not her style<br>
I’ve read where it’s said that she sleeps in a bed made of satin<br>
She’s had her face done in every place you can try<br>
They say she gets a piece of every lease in Manhattan<br>
And says she’s thirty when she’s really pushing forty-five</p>
<p>That’s not her style I can tell you<br>
That ain’t my woman<br>
It’s just not her style I can tell you<br>
Because I’m her man<br>
You know it’s not her style I can tell you<br>
That ain’t my woman<br>
It’s just not her style I can tell you<br>
Because I’m her man</p>
