          <p>I’m young enough to still see the passionate boy I used to be<br>But I’m old enough to say I got a good look at the other side<br>I know we got to work real hard, maybe even for the rest of our lives<br>But right now I just want to take what I can get tonight</p>
<p>While the night is still young<br>I want to keep making love to you<br>While the night is still young</p>
<p>I’d like to settle down<br>Get married<br>And maybe have a child someday<br>I can see a time coming when I’m gonna throw my suitcase out<br>No more separations<br>Where you have to say goodnight to a telephone<br>Baby I’ve decided that ain’t what life is all about</p>
<p>Oh<br>While the night is still young<br>While the night is still young<br>I want to try to make the world brand new<br>While the night is still young</p>
<p>Rock and roll music was the only thing I<br>Ever gave a damn about<br>There was something that was missing<br>But I never used to wonder why<br>Now I know you’re the one I needed<br>To make things right again<br>And I may lose the battle<br>But you’re giving me the will to try<br>Oh</p>
<p>While the night is still young<br>I want to keep making love to you</p>
<p>’Cause the night is still young<br>I’ve got a lot of catching up to do<br>While the night is still young<br>While the night is still young</p>
<p>While the night is still young<br>I want to try to make the world brand new<br>While the night is still young<br>I want to keep making love to you<br>While the night is still young<br>While the night is still young</p>
