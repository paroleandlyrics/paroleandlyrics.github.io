          <p>Even though I’m in love<br>
Sometimes I get so afraid<br>
I’ll say something so wrong<br>
Just to have something to say</p>
<p>I know the moment isn’t right<br>
To tell the girl a comical line<br>
To keep the conversation light<br>
I guess I’m just frightened out of my mind<br>
But if that’s how I feel<br>
Then it’s the best feeling I’ve ever known<br>
It’s undeniably real<br>
Leave a tender moment alone</p>
<p>Yes I know I’m in love<br>
But just when I ought to relax I put my foot in my mouth Cause I’m just avoiding the facts</p>
<p>If the girl gets too close<br>
If I need some room to escape<br>
When the moment arose<br>
I’d tell her it’s all a mistake</p>
<p>But that’s not how I feel<br>
No that’s not the woman I’ve known<br>
She’s undeniably real<br>
So leave a tender moment alone</p>
<p>But it’s not only me<br>
Breaking down when the tension gets high<br>
Just when I’m in a serious mood<br>
She is suddenly quite and shy</p>
<p>Leave a tender moment alone<br>
Leave it alone</p>
<p>I know the moment isn’t right<br>
To hold my emotions inside<br>
To change the attitude tonight<br>
I’ve run out of places to hide<br>
And if that’s how I feel<br>
Then it’s the best feeling I’ve ever known<br>
It’s undeniably real<br>
Leave a tender moment alone<br>
You got to leave a tender moment alone<br>
Leave a tender moment alone<br>
Leave it alone<br>
You got to leave a tender moment alone<br>
Leave a tender moment alone</p>
