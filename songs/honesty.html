          <p>If you search for tenderness<br>It isn't hard to find<br>You can have the love you need to live<br>But if you look for truthfulness<br>You might just as well be blind<br>It always seems to be so hard to give</p>
<p>Honesty is such a lonely word<br>Everyone is so untrue<br>Honesty is hardly ever heard<br>And mostly what I need from you</p>
<p>I can always find someone<br>To say they sympathize<br>If I wear my heart out on my sleeve<br>But I don't want some pretty face<br>To tell me pretty lies<br>All I want is someone to believe</p>
<p>Honesty is such a lonely word<br>Everyone is so untrue<br>Honesty is hardly ever heard<br>And mostly what I need from you</p>
<p>I can find a lover<br>I can find a friend<br>I can have security<br>Until the bitter end<br>Anyone can comfort me<br>With promises again<br>I know, I know</p>
<p>When I'm deep inside of me<br>Don't be too concerned<br>I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone<br>But when I want sincerity<br>Tell me where else can I turn<br>Because you're the only one that I depend on</p>
<p>Honesty is such a lonely word<br>Everyone is so untrue<br>Honesty is hardly ever heard<br>And mostly what I need from you</p>
