          <p>We walked on the beach beside that old hotel<br>
They’re tearin’ it down now, but it’s just as well<br>
I haven’t shown you everything a man can do<br>
So stay with me, baby<br>
I’ve got plans for you</p>
<p>This is the time to remember<br>
‘Cause it will not last forever<br>
These are the days to hold on to<br>
‘Cause we won’t, although we’ll want to<br>
This is the time,<br>
But time is gonna change<br>
You’ve given me the best of you<br>
But now I need the rest of you</p>
<p>Did you know that before you came into my life<br>
It was some kind of miracle that I survived<br>
Some day we will both look back<br>
And have to laugh<br>
We lived through a lifetime<br>
And the aftermath</p>
<p>This is the time to remember<br>
‘Cause it will not last forever<br>
These are the days to hold on to<br>
‘Cause we won’t, although we want to<br>
This is the time,<br>
But time is gonna change<br>
I know we’ve got to move somehow<br>
But I don’t want to lose you now</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s so easy<br>
To let a day slip on by<br>
Without even seeing each other at all<br>
But this is the time you’ll turn back to and so will I<br>
And those will be days you can never recall</p>
<p>And so we embrace again<br>
Behind the dunes<br>
This beach is so cold on winter afternoons<br>
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun<br>
I’m warm from the memory of days to come<br>
This is the time to remember<br>
‘Cause it will not last forever<br>
These are the days to hold on to<br>
‘Cause we won’t, although we’ll want to<br>
This is the time,<br>
But time is gonna change<br>
You’ve given me the best of you<br>
But now I need the rest of you</p>
