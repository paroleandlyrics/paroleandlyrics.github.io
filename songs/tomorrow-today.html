          <p>I’ve been livin’ for the moment<br>
But I just can’t have my way<br>
And I’m afraid to go to sleep<br>
‘Cause tomorrow is today</p>
<p>People tell me life is sweeter<br>
But I don’t hear what they say<br>
Nothing comes to change my life<br>
So tomorrow is today</p>
<p>I don’t care to know the hour<br>
‘Cause it’s passing anyway<br>
I don’t have to see tomorrow<br>
‘Cause I saw it yesterday</p>
<p>So I listen for an answer<br>
But the feeling seems to stay<br>
And what’s the use of always dreaming<br>
If tomorrow is today, oh</p>
<p>Still I’m waiting for the morning<br>
But it feels so far away<br>
And you don’t need the love I’m giving<br>
So tomorrow is today</p>
<p>Oh my, I’m goin’ to the river<br>
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me<br>
Make my bed, I’m gonna lie in it<br>
If you don’t come, I’m sure gonna die in it<br>
Too late, too much givin’</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of life and I’m damn sick of livin’ it<br>
I keep hopin’ that you will pass my way<br>
And someday if your dreams are leavin’ you<br>
I’ll still believe in you</p>
<p>Though I’m living and I’m singing<br>
And although my hands still play<br>
Soon enough it will all be over ’cause<br>
Tomorrow is today</p>
