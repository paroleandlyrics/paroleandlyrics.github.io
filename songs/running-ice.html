          <p>There’s a lot of tension in this town<br>
I know it’s building up inside of me<br>
I’ve got all the symptoms and the side effects<br>
Of city life anxiety</p>
<p>I could never understand why the urban attitude<br>
Is so superior<br>
In a world of high rise ambition<br>
Most people’s motives are ulterior</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel as though I’m running on ice<br>
Paying the price too long<br>
Kind of get the feeling that I’m running on ice<br>
Where did my life go wrong</p>
<p>I’m a cosmopolitan sophisticate<br>
Of culture and intelligence<br>
The culmination of technology<br>
And civilized experience</p>
<p>But I’m carrying the weight of all the useless junk<br>
A modern man accumulates<br>
I’m a statistic in a system<br>
That a civil servant dominates</p>
<p>And all that means is that I’m running on ice<br>
Caught in a vise so strong<br>
I’m slipping and sliding, cause I’m running on ice<br>
Where did my life go wrong</p>
<p>You’ve got to run<br>
You’ve got to run</p>
<p>As fast as I can climb<br>
A new disaster every time I turn around<br>
As soon as I get one fire put out<br>
There’s another building burning down</p>
<p>They say this highway’s going my way<br>
But I don’t know where it’s taking me<br>
It’s a bad waste, a sad case, a rat race<br>
It’s breaking me</p>
<p>I get no traction cause I’m running on ice<br>
It’s taking me twice as long<br>
I get a bad reaction cause I’m running on ice<br>
Where did my life go wrong</p>
<p>You’ve got to run<br>
You’ve got to run<br>
Running on ice<br>
Running on ice<br>
Running on ice</p>
