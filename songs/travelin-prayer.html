          <p>Hey Lord, take a look around tonight<br>
And find where my baby’s gonna be<br>
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight<br>
‘Cause she is far across the sea<br>
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight<br>
And make sure she’s gonna be alright<br>
And things are gonna be alright with me</p>
<p>Hey Lord, would you look out for her tonight<br>
And make sure all her dreams are sweet<br>
Hey Lord, would ya guide her along the roads<br>
And make them softer for her feet<br>
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight<br>
And make sure that she’s gonna be alright<br>
Until she’s home in here with me</p>
<p>Hey Lord, would you look out for her tonight<br>
If she is sleepin’ under the sky<br>
Hey Lord, make sure the ground she’s sleepin’ on<br>
Is always warm and dry<br>
Hey don’t you give her too much rain<br>
But try to keep her away from pain<br>
‘Cause my baby hates to cry</p>
<p>Hey Lord, won’t you look out for her tonight<br>
‘Cause it gets rough along the way<br>
Said Lord, if this song sounds strange<br>
It’s just because I don’t know how to pray<br>
So won’t you give her peace of mind<br>
And if you ever find the time<br>
Won’t you tell her I miss her ev’ry day</p>
