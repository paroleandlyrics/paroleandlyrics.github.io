          <p>She cuts you once, she cuts you twice<br>
But still you believe<br>
The wound is so fresh you can taste the blood<br>
But you don’t have strength to leave<br>
You’ve been bought, you’ve been sold<br>
You’ve been locked outside the door<br>
But you stand there pleadin’<br>
With your insides bleedin’<br>
‘Cause deep down you want some more<br>
Then she says she wants forgiveness<br>
It’s such a clever masquerade<br>
She’s so good with her stiletto<br>
You don’t even see the blade</p>
<p>She cuts you hard, she cuts you deep<br>
She’s got so much skill<br>
She’s so fascinating that you’re still there waiting<br>
When she comes back for the kill<br>
You’ve been slashed in the face<br>
You’ve been left there to bleed<br>
You want to run away<br>
But you know you’re gonna stay<br>
‘Cause she gives you what you need<br>
Then she says she needs affection<br>
While she searches for the vein<br>
She’s so good with her stiletto<br>
You don’t really mind the pain</p>
<p>She cuts you out, she cuts you down<br>
She carves up your life<br>
But you won’t do nothing<br>
As she keeps on cutting<br>
‘Cause you know you love the knife<br>
You’ve been bought, you’ve been sold<br>
You’ve been locked outside the door<br>
But you stand there pleadin’<br>
With your insides bleedin’<br>
‘Cause deep down you want some more<br>
Then she says she needs affection<br>
While she searches for the vein<br>
She’s so good with her stiletto<br>
You don’t really mind the pain</p>
