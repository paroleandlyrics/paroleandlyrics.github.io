          <p>He always found it hard to take her<br>
She wouldn’t listen to advice<br>
And though he never tried to make her<br>
She often thought it would be nice</p>
<p>Oh-and now she’s headin’ out to California<br>
It’s been a long time comin’ but she’s feelin’ like a woman tonight<br>
And she left a little letter said she’s gonna make a stop in Nevada<br>
Good bye, goodbye</p>
<p>She tried for years to be a good wife<br>
It never quite got off the ground<br>
And all those stories of the good life<br>
Convinced her not to hang around</p>
<p>Oh-and now she’s headin’ out to California<br>
It’s been a long time comin’ but she’s feelin’ like a woman tonight<br>
And she left a little letter said she’s gonna make a stop in Nevada<br>
Good bye, goodbye</p>
<p>And though she finds it hard to leave him<br>
She knows it would be worse to stay<br>
He wouldn’t understand the reasons<br>
That make a woman run away</p>
<p>Oh-and now she’s headin’ out to California<br>
With some money in her pocket, she’s a rocket on the Fourth of July<br>
And she left a little letter said she’s gonna make a stop in Nevada<br>
Good bye, goodbye</p>
