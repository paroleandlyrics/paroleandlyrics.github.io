          <p>Now we take our time, so nonchalant<br>
And spend our nights so bon vivant<br>
We dress our days in silken robes<br>
The money comes<br>
The money goes<br>
We know it’s all a passing phase</p>
<p>We light our lamps for atmosphere<br>
And hang our hopes on chandeliers<br>
We’re going wrong, we’re gaining weight<br>
We’re sleeping long and far too late<br>
And so it’s time to change our ways<br>
But I’ve loved these days</p>
<p>Now as we indulge in things refined<br>
We hide our hearts from harder times<br>
A string of pearls, a foreign car<br>
Oh we can only go so far<br>
On caviar and cabernet</p>
<p>We drown our doubts in dry champagne<br>
And soothe our souls with fine cocaine<br>
I don’t know why I even care<br>
We’ll get so high and get nowhere<br>
We’ll have to change our jaded ways<br>
But I’ve loved these days</p>
<p>So before we end and then begin<br>
We’ll drink a toast to how it’s been<br>
A few more hours to be complete<br>
A few more nights on satin sheets<br>
A few more times that I can say<br>
I’ve loved these days</p>
