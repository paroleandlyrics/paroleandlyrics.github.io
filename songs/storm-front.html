          <p>Safe at harbor, everything is easy<br>
Off to starboard, daylight comes up fast<br>
Now I’m restless for the open water<br>
Red flags are flying from the Coast Guard mast<br>
They told me to stay, I heard all the information<br>
I motored away and steered straight ahead<br>
Though the weatherman said</p>
<p>There’s a storm front coming (mood indigo)<br>
White water running and the pressure is low<br>
Storm front coming (mood indigo)<br>
Small craft warning on the radio</p>
<p>I’ve been sailing a long time on this ocean<br>
Man gets lonesome, all those years at sea<br>
I’ve got a woman, my life should be easy<br>
Most men hunger for the life I lead<br>
The morning was gray, but I had the motivation<br>
I drifted away and ran into more<br>
Heavy weather off shore</p>
<p>There’s a storm front coming (mood indigo)<br>
White water running and the pressure is low<br>
Storm front coming (mood indigo)<br>
Small craft warning on the radio</p>
<p>We’ve got a low pressure system and a northeast breeze<br>
We’ve got a falling barometer and rising seas<br>
We’ve got the cumulonimbus and a possible gale<br>
We’ve got a force nine blowing on the Beaufort scale</p>
<p>I’m still restless for the open water<br>
Though she gives me everything I need<br>
She asked me to stay, but I’d done my navigation<br>
I drove her away, but I should have known<br>
To stay tied up at home</p>
<p>There’s a storm front coming (mood indigo)<br>
White water running and the pressure is low<br>
Storm front coming (mood indigo)<br>
Small craft warning on the radio</p>
