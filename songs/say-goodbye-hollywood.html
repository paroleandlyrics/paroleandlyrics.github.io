          <p>Bobby’s drivin’ through the city tonight<br>
Through the lights in a hot new rent-a-car<br>
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine<br>
It’s a scene down on Sunset Boulevard<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby</p>
<p>Johnny’s takin’ care of things for a while<br>
And his style is so right for troubadours<br>
They got him sitting with his back to the door<br>
Now he won’t be my fast gun anymore<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby</p>
<p>Movin’ on is a chance that you have to take<br>
Any time you try to stay – together<br>
Whoa<br>
Say a word out of line<br>
And you find that the friends you had<br>
Are gone – forever<br>
Forever</p>
<p>So many faces in and out of my life<br>
Some will last<br>
Some will be just now and then<br>
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes<br>
I’m afraid it’s time for goodbye again<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby</p>
<p>Movin’ on is a chance that you have to take<br>
Any time you try to stay – together<br>
Whoa<br>
Say a word out of line<br>
And you find that the friends you had<br>
Are gone – forever<br>
Forever</p>
<p>So many faces in and out of my life<br>
Some will last<br>
Some will be just now and then<br>
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes<br>
I’m afraid it’s time for goodbye again<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby<br>
Say goodbye to Hollywood<br>
Say goodbye my baby</p>
