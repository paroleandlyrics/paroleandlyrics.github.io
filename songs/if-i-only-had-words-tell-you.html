          <p>If I only had the words to tell you<br>
If you only had the time to understand<br>
Though I know it wouldn’t change your feelings<br>
And I know you’ll carry on the best you can</p>
<p>If I only had the urge to tell you<br>
If you only know how hard it is to say<br>
When the simple lines have all been taken<br>
And the radio repeats them ev’ry day</p>
<p>If I never find the song to sing you<br>
If you always find it hard to comprehend<br>
Well you know there wouldn’t be much meaning<br>
If I had to sing those tired words again<br>
Life goes on and on, and tonight will soon be gone<br>
But if we try we can be sure</p>
<p>If I only had the words to tell you<br>
If you only had the time to understand<br>
But I only have these arms to hold you<br>
And it’s all that you can ask of any man</p>
