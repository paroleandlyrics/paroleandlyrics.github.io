          <p>All my life<br>
I’ve searched this whole world through<br>
Try as I might<br>
To find someone like you</p>
<p>Years drifted by<br>
But it was always on my mind<br>
I didn’t know just how long I’d go<br>
Until I ran out of time</p>
<p>All my life<br>
I’ve hurt the ones who cared<br>
One by one<br>
No loving heart was spared</p>
<p>I’ve been a wild and restless man<br>
But still a man who needs a wife<br>
That was my dream and now it seems<br>
You’ve taken all my life</p>
<p>For as long as I could<br>
My intentions were good<br>
I assumed my affairs<br>
Would be fine</p>
<p>But I know very well<br>
There’s a long road to hell<br>
That’s been paved with<br>
Intentions like mine</p>
<p>All my life<br>
I’ve paid for my mistakes<br>
After a while<br>
The strongest spirit breaks</p>
<p>I’ve had heartache and pain<br>
That cut me deeper than a knife<br>
Ah, but those days are done<br>
‘Cause you’re the one<br>
I’ve wanted all my life</p>
<p>And I know very well<br>
There’s a long road to hell<br>
That’s been paved with<br>
Intentions like mine</p>
<p>All my life<br>
My stars were surely crossed<br>
Now and then<br>
I missed the love I lost</p>
<p>But all that changed<br>
The day you said you’d be my wife<br>
Who could have known<br>
That finding you would only take me<br>
All my life</p>
