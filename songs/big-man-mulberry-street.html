          <p>Why can’t I lay low<br>
Why can’t I say what I mean<br>
Why don’t I stay home<br>
And get myself into some boring routine</p>
<p>Why can’t I calm down<br>
Why is it always a fight<br>
I can’t get unwound<br>
Why do I throw myself into the night</p>
<p>I’m on the outside<br>
I don’t fit into the groove<br>
Now I ain’t a bad guy<br>
So tell me what am I trying to prove</p>
<p>Why can’t I cool out<br>
Why don’t I button my lip<br>
Why do I lash out<br>
Why is it I always shoot from the hip</p>
<p>I cruise for Houston to Canal street<br>
A misfit and a rebel<br>
I see the winos talking to themselves<br>
And I can understand<br>
Why is it everytime I go out<br>
I always seem to get in trouble<br>
I guess I made an impression on somebody<br>
North of Hester and south of Grand</p>
<p>And so in my small way<br>
I’m a big man on Mulberry street<br>
I don’t mean all day<br>
Only at night when I’m light on my feet</p>
<p>What else have I got<br>
That I’d be trying to hide<br>
Maybe a blind spot<br>
I haven’t seen from the sensitive side</p>
<p>But you know in my own heart<br>
I’m a big man on Mulberry street<br>
I play the whole part<br>
I leave a big tip with every receipt</p>
<p>I’m so romantic<br>
I’m such a passionate man<br>
Sometimes I panic<br>
What if nobody finds out who I am</p>
