          <p>I don’t believe in first impressions<br>
For just this once I hope that looks don’t deceive<br>
I ain’t got time for true confessions<br>
I’ve got to make the move right now<br>
Got to meet that girl somehow<br>
I’ve gotta get it right the first time<br>
That’s the main thing<br>
I can’t afford to let it pass<br>
You get it right the next time that’s not the same thing<br>
Gonna have to make the first time last.<br>
I’m not much good at conversation<br>
I never was too smooth at comin’ on real strong<br>
If all it takes is inspiration<br>
Then I might have just what it takes<br>
If I don’t make no bad mistakes and I<br>
I’ve gotta get it right the first time<br>
That’s the main thing<br>
I can’t afford to let it pass<br>
You get it right the next time that’s not the same thing<br>
Gonna have to make the first time last.<br>
I might find the courage<br>
Yeah I might get up the nerve<br>
But if my timing ain’t just right what purpose would it serve?<br>
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know how<br>
To say those first few words<br>
If I want to put myself in touch<br>
The first few moments mean so much<br>
So I suppose it’s now or never<br>
Before that woman walks right out of my life<br>
Just let me pull myself together<br>
I’ve got to give it one good try<br>
Gotta take my chance tonight<br>
I’ve gotta get it right the first time<br>
That’s the main thing<br>
I can’t afford to let it pass<br>
You get it right the next time that’s not the same thing<br>
Gonna have to make the first time last.</p>
