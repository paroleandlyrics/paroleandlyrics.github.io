          <p>Saturday night and you’re still hangin’ around<br>
You’re tired of livin’ in your one horse town<br>
You’d like to find a little hole in the ground for a while</p>
<p>So you go to the village in your tie-dye jeans<br>
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens<br>
It’s like some pornographic magazine, and you smile</p>
<p>But Captain Jack will get you high tonight<br>
And take you to your special island<br>
Captain Jack will get you by tonight<br>
Just a little push ‘n’ you’ll be smilin’<br>
Oh yeah, yeah</p>
<p>Your sister’s gone out, she’s on a date<br>
And you just sit at home and masturbate<br>
Your phone is gonna ring soon,<br>
But you just can’t wait, for that call</p>
<p>So you stand on the corner in your new English clothes<br>
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes<br>
But still your fingers gonna pick your nose, after all</p>
<p>But Captain Jack will get you high tonight<br>
And take you to your special island<br>
Captain Jack will get you by tonight<br>
Just a little push ‘n’ you’ll be smilin’<br>
Oh yeah, yeah</p>
<p>So you decide to take a holiday<br>
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet<br>
Ah, but there’s no place to go anyway and what for<br>
You’ve got everything, but nothin’s cool<br>
They just found your father in the swimming pool<br>
And you guess you won’t be going back to school anymore</p>
<p>But Captain Jack will get you high tonight<br>
And take you to your special island<br>
Captain Jack will get you by tonight<br>
Just a little push ‘n’ you’ll be smilin’<br>
La da, da<br>
Oh yeah, yeah</p>
<p>So you play your albums and you smoke your pot<br>
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot<br>
Oh, but still you’re aching for the things you haven’t got,<br>
What went wrong</p>
<p>And if you can’t understand why your world is so dead<br>
And why you’ve got to keep in style and feed your head<br>
Well, you’re twenty one and still you mother makes your bed<br>
And that’s too long</p>
<p>But Captain Jack will get you high tonight<br>
And take you to your special island<br>
Captain Jack will get you by tonight<br>
Just a little push ‘n’ you’ll be smilin’<br>
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you by tonight<br>
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you by tonight</p>
