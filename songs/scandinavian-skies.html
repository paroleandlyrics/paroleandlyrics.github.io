          <p>The sins of Amsterdam<br>
Were still a recent surprise<br>
And we were flying over<br>
Scandinavian skies</p>
<p>We climbed towards the sun<br>
We turned and cursed as one<br>
We pulled the shades<br>
And closed our eyes</p>
<p>The Stockholm city lights<br>
Were slowly starting to rise<br>
And we were strapped against<br>
Those Scandinavian skies</p>
<p>The landing gear came down<br>
And touched the Swedish ground<br>
And we were all so paralyzed</p>
<p>On the plane<br>
We were mainly sound and lights<br>
In the veins<br>
We could play the blues all night</p>
<p>The tour of Germany<br>
Was bleeding into our eyes<br>
And we were sailing over<br>
Scandinavian skies</p>
<p>We had the Midas touch<br>
Until we met the Dutch<br>
And they exhausted our supplies</p>
<p>Who’s to pay?<br>
For this international flight<br>
Who could stay<br>
We were only there for the night<br>
We watched the power fall<br>
Inside the Oslo hall<br>
While all the cold Norwegians cried</p>
<p>Who could say<br>
What was left and where was right?<br>
By the way<br>
I could play the blues all night</p>
