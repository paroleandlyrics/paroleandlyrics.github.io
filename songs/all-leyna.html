          <p>She stood on the tracks<br>
Waving her arms<br>
Leading me to that third rail shock<br>
Quick as a wink<br>
She changed her mind</p>
<p>She gave me a night<br>
That’s all it was<br>
What will it take until I stop<br>
Kidding myself<br>
Wasting my time</p>
<p>There’s nothing else I can do<br>
‘Cause I’m doing it all for Leyna<br>
I don’t want anyone new<br>
‘Cause I’m living it all for Leyna<br>
There’s nothing in it for you<br>
‘Cause I’m giving it all to Leyna</p>
<p>We laid on the beach<br>
Watching the tide<br>
She didn’t tell me there were rocks<br>
Under the waves<br>
Right off the shore<br>
Washed up on the sand<br>
Barely alive<br>
Wishing the undertow would stop<br>
How can a man take anymore</p>
<p>There’s nothing else I can do<br>
‘Cause I’m doing it all for Leyna<br>
I don’t want anyone new<br>
‘Cause I’m living it all for Leyna<br>
There’s nothing in it for you<br>
‘Cause I’m giving it all to Leyna<br>
I’m failing in school<br>
Losing my friends<br>
Making my family lose their minds<br>
I don’t want to eat<br>
I don’t want to sleep<br>
I only want Leyna one more time</p>
<p>Now I’m in my room<br>
Watching the tube<br>
Telling myself she still may drop<br>
Over to say<br>
She’s changed her mind</p>
<p>So, I wait in the dark<br>
Listening for her<br>
Instead of my old man saying stop…<br>
Kidding yourself<br>
Wasting your time</p>
<p>There’s nothing else I can do<br>
‘Cause I’m doing it all for Leyna<br>
I don’t want anyone new<br>
‘Cause I’m living it all for Leyna<br>
There’s nothing in it for you<br>
‘Cause I’m giving it all to Leyna</p>
<p>All to Leyna<br>
All to Leyna</p>
