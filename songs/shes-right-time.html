          <p>Turn on all the Christmas lights<br>
Cause baby’s coming home tonight<br>
I can hear her footsteps in the street<br>
Turn the choral music higher<br>
Pile more wood upon the fire<br>
That should make the atmosphere complete<br>
I’ve had to wait forever<br>
But better late than never</p>
<p>She’s just in time for me<br>
She’s right on time<br>
She’s right where she should be<br>
She’s right on time</p>
<p>I’m a man with so much tension<br>
Far too many sins to mention<br>
She don’t have to take it anymore<br>
But since she said she’s coming home<br>
I’ve torn out all my telephones<br>
Soon she will be walking through that door<br>
I may be going nowhere<br>
But I don’t mind if she’s there</p>
<p>She’s just in time for me<br>
She’s right on time<br>
She’s right where she should be<br>
She’s right on time</p>
<p>Left to my own device<br>
I can always make believe<br>
That there’s nothing wrong<br>
Still I will choose to live<br>
In the complicated world<br>
That we shared for so long<br>
Good or bad, right or wrong</p>
<p>And it occurred to me<br>
While I set up my Christmas tree<br>
She never missed a cue or lost a beat<br>
Everytime I lost the meter<br>
There she was when I would need her<br>
Greeting me with footsteps in the street<br>
I guess I should have known it<br>
She’d find the perfect moment</p>
<p>She’s just in time for me<br>
She’s right on time<br>
She’s right where she should be<br>
She’s right on time</p>
<p>Turn the choral music higher<br>
Pile more wood upon the fire<br>
That will make the atmosphere complete<br>
I’ve had to wait forever<br>
But better late than never</p>
<p>She’s just in time for me<br>
She’s right on time<br>
She’s right where she should be<br>
She’s right on time<br>
She’s right on time<br>
She’s right on time</p>
