          <p>Oh, baby you don’t get turned on by the radio<br>
Oh, baby you got nothin’ to play on your stereo<br>
“Why don’t the Beatles get back together?<br>
Why don’t nobody sing of romance?<br>
Oh, baby, all you wanna do is dance</p>
<p>Oh, baby I think you are lost in the seventies<br>
Oh, baby the music she ain’t what she used to be<br>
You don’t understand what they’re saying<br>
Givin’ it ev’ry chance<br>
Oh, baby, all you wanna do is dance</p>
<p>Well, you wish you were back in the good old days<br>
When tomatoes were cheaper<br>
And you never heard the words of your favorite songs<br>
Through a three inch speaker<br>
And you never messed around with dangerous drugs<br>
You were all getting sick on beer<br>
And you didn’t get any unless you went steady and made out for a year</p>
<p>You can hide away honey in your rock ‘n’ roll dreams<br>
An’ you can stand by your blue suede shoes<br>
But the party is over and I’m getting tired of waiting for you</p>
<p>Oh, baby where are the oldies they used to play<br>
Oh, baby you want to crawl back into yesterday<br>
You don’t want to deal with the future<br>
You don’t want to make any plans<br>
Oh, baby, all you wanna do is dance<br>
Oh, baby, all you wanna do is dance</p>
