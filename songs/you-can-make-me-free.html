          <p>You can make me free<br>
You can make me smile<br>
You can make me be like a little child<br>
You can melt the ice that chills my body<br>
You can dry my ev’ry tear<br>
You can make the lonely hours disappear<br>
You can make me free<br>
You can make me rise<br>
You can make me see<br>
So open up my eyes<br>
Don’t you know my only real moments are the ones I spend with you?<br>
How I long to drink some wine again with you?<br>
I can take the skies<br>
I can soar like a bird<br>
With his heart full of song, yeah, yeah<br>
Won’t you color my eyes?<br>
I’ve been writing so long</p>
<p>You can make me free<br>
You can make me cry<br>
You can make it so much better if you only try<br>
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime<br>
Until I am with you, my love<br>
I will wait when you’ll be what I’m dreaming of<br>
I can take the skies<br>
I can soar like a bird<br>
With his heart full of song, yeah, yeah<br>
Won’t you color my eyes?<br>
I’ve been writing so long</p>
<p>You can make me free<br>
You can make me cry<br>
You can make it so much better if you only try<br>
And if I must wait a lonely lifetime<br>
Until I am with you, my love<br>
I will wait when you’ll be what I’m dreaming of<br>
You can make me free<br>
You can make me cry<br>
I know you know that you can make it so much better<br>
If you would only try, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
