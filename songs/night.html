          <p>Didn’t I say<br>
I wasn’t ready for a romance<br>
Didn’t we promise<br>
We would only be friends</p>
<p>And so we danced<br>
Though it was only a slow dance<br>
I started breaking my promises<br>
Right there and then</p>
<p>Didn’t I swear<br>
There would be no complications<br>
Didn’t you want<br>
Someone who’s seen it all before</p>
<p>Now that you’re here<br>
It’s not the same situation<br>
Suddenly I don’t remember the rules anymore</p>
<p>This night is mine<br>
It’s only you and I<br>
Tomorrow<br>
Is a long time away<br>
This night can last forever</p>
<p>I’ve been around<br>
Someone like me should know better<br>
Falling in love<br>
Would be the worst thing I could do</p>
<p>Didn’t I say<br>
I needed time to forget her<br>
Aren’t you running from someone<br>
Who’s not over you</p>
<p>How many nights<br>
Have I been lonely without you<br>
I tell myself<br>
How much I really don’t care</p>
<p>How many nights<br>
Have I been thinking about you<br>
Wanting to hold you<br>
But knowing you would not be there</p>
<p>This night<br>
You’re mine<br>
It’s only you and I<br>
I’ll tell you<br>
To forget yesterday<br>
This night we are together</p>
<p>This night<br>
Is mine<br>
It’s only you and I<br>
Tomorrow<br>
Is such a long time away<br>
This night can last forever</p>
<p>Tomorrow<br>
Is such a long time away<br>
This night can last forever</p>
