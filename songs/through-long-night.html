          <p>The cold hands<br>
The sad eyes<br>
The dark Irish silence<br>
It’s so late<br>
But I’ll wait<br>
Through the long night with you<br>
With you</p>
<p>The warm tears<br>
The bad dreams<br>
The soft trembling shoulders<br>
The old fears<br>
But I’m here<br>
Through the long night with you<br>
With you</p>
<p>Oh, what has it cost you<br>
I almost lost you<br>
A long, long time ago<br>
Oh, you should have told me<br>
But you had to bleed to know</p>
<p>All your past sins<br>
Are since past<br>
You should be sleeping<br>
It’s all right<br>
Sleep tight<br>
Through the long night with me<br>
With me</p>
<p>No, I didn’t start it<br>
You’re broken hearted<br>
From a long, long time ago<br>
Oh, the way you hold me<br>
Is all that I need to know</p>
<p>And it’s so late<br>
But I’ll wait<br>
Through the long night with you<br>
With you</p>
